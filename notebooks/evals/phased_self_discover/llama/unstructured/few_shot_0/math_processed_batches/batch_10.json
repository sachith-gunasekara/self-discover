The first term can be rewritten as $\\sqrt{x^2 + 400} = \\sqrt{(x-0)^2 + 20^2}$. Similarly, the second term becomes $\\sqrt{y^2 + 900} = \\sqrt{(y-0)^2 + 30^2}$.

It is a technical problem that requires specific expertise in geometry and algebra.\n\n## Step 7: Develop a step-by-step plan to find the minimum value\nTo find the minimum value, we can use the Triangle Inequality, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is greater than or equal to the length of the third side.

This means we need to find all the integers between 1 and 99 (inclusive) whose greatest common divisor with 100 is a number between 1 and 9 (inclusive).\n\n**Step 2: Break down the problem**\nTo solve this problem, we need to analyze the prime factors of 100, which are $2^2 \\cdot 5^2$. These prime factors will impact the possible values of $\\gcd(m,100)$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine possible values of $\\gcd(m,100)$**\nThe possible values of $\\gcd(m,100)$ that are single-digit numbers are 1, 2, 4, and 5. These values are possible because they are the divisors of 100 that are single-digit numbers.\n\n**Step 4: Find the corresponding ranges of $m$ for each possible value of $\\gcd(m,100)$**\nFor each possible value of $\\gcd(m,100)$, we need to find the corresponding range of $m$ values that satisfy the condition.\n\n- For $\\gcd(m,100) = 1$, $m$ can be any number between 1 and 100 that is relatively prime to 100. There are 40 such numbers (1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 23, 27, 29, 31, 33, 37, 39, 41, 43, 47, 49, 51, 53, 57, 59, 61, 63, 67, 69, 71, 73, 77, 79, 81, 83, 87, 89, 91, 93, 97, 99).\n- For $\\gcd(m,100) = 2$, $m$ can be any even number between 2 and 100 that is not divisible by 4 or 5.

There are 10 such numbers (5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 75, 85, 95).\n\n**Step 5: Count the number of integers $m$ for each possible value of $\\gcd(m,100)$**\nFor each possible value of $\\gcd(m,100)$, we need to count the number of integers $m$ that satisfy the condition.\n\n- For $\\gcd(m,100) = 1$, there are 40 integers.\n- For $\\gcd(m,100) = 2$, there are 20 integers (we counted 2 in the previous step, and the other 19 integers are 6, 14, 18, 22, 26, 34, 38, 42, 46, 54, 58, 62, 66, 74, 78, 82, 86, 94, 98).\n- For $\\gcd(m,100) = 4$, there are 20 integers (we counted 4 in the previous step, and the other 19 integers are 12, 16, 24, 28, 32, 36, 44, 48, 52, 56, 64, 68, 72, 76, 84, 88, 92, 96).\n- For $\\gcd(m,100) = 5$, there are 10 integers.\n\n**Step 6: Sum up the counts for each possible value of $\\gcd(m,100)$**\nWe add up the counts for each possible value of $\\gcd(m,100)$ to find the total number of integers $m$ that satisfy the condition.\n\n40 + 20 + 20 + 10 = 90\n\nHowever, we counted some integers more than once.

We counted all of them except 10, 20, 25 and 50 (we did not count 100 because m < 100), so we need to add 4 to the total count.\n\n51 + 4 = 55\n\nHowever, 10 and 50 are counted twice, so we need to subtract 2 from the total count.\n\n55 - 2 = 53\n\nHowever, 20 is also counted twice, so we need to subtract 1 from the total count.\n\n53 - 1 = 52\n\nHowever, 25 and 50 was not supposed to be counted since there is a 100, so we need to subtract 2 from the total count.\n\n52 - 2 = 50\n\nHowever, 10 and 20 was not supposed to be counted since there is a 100, so we need to subtract 2 from the total count.\n\n50 - 2 = 48\n\nHowever, we are not done yet. The integer 50 has 3 divisors that are less than 100 and are single-digit numbers (1, 2, 5). We counted all of them, so we don't need to add anything to the total count.\n\nHowever, we are not done yet.

We will use a systematic approach to count the number of handshakes.\n\n**Step 3: Break down the problem**\nLet's break down the problem by counting the number of handshakes for each person. Since each person shakes hands with at most 20 other people, the maximum number of handshakes for each person is 20.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the constraints**\nThe constraint is that each handshake is unique, meaning that if person A shakes hands with person B, it is the same handshake as person B shaking hands with person A.
