These equations represent a relationship between the variables $a$ and $b$.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the given equations**\nTo simplify the equations, we can rewrite them as $ab^2=\\frac{27}{5}$ and $a^2b=135$. No further simplification is possible at this stage.\n\n**Step 3: Solve for $a$ in terms of $b$ or vice versa**\nFrom the first equation, we can solve for $a$ in terms of $b$ as $a = \\frac{27}{5b^2}$. From the second equation, we can solve for $b$ in terms of $a$ as $b = \\frac{135}{a^2}$.\n\n**Step 4: Use substitution to eliminate one variable**\nSubstituting $b = \\frac{135}{a^2}$ into the first equation, we get $a\\left(\\frac{135}{a^2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{27}{5}$. Simplifying this equation, we get $a\\cdot\\frac{18225}{a^4} = \\frac{27}{5}$.\n\n**Step 5: Solve for the remaining variable**\nMultiplying both sides by $a^4$ and dividing by 18225, we get $a = \\frac{27}{5}\\cdot\\frac{a^4}{18225}$. Simplifying further, we get $a = \\frac{27}{5}\\cdot\\frac{a^4}{3^4\\cdot 5^2\\cdot 3^2}$. This reduces to $a = \\frac{a^4}{3^3\\cdot 5\\cdot a^3}$. Canceling out $a^3$ from both numerator and denominator, we get $a = \\frac{a}{3^3\\cdot 5}$. Therefore, $a^3 = \\frac{1}{3^3\\cdot 5}$. Taking the cube root of both sides, we get $a = \\frac{1}{3\\cdot\\sqrt[3]{5}} = \\frac{1}{3\\cdot\\sqrt[3]{5}}\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{5^2}}{\\sqrt[3]{5^2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt[3]{5^2}}{3\\cdot\\sqrt[3]{5^3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt[3]{25}}{3\\cdot 5} = \\frac{\\sqrt[3]{25}}{15}$.\n\n**Step 6: Find the value of the other variable**\nSubstituting $a = \\frac{\\sqrt[3]{25}}{15}$ into the equation $b = \\frac{135}{a^2}$, we get $b = \\frac{135}{\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{25}}{15}\\right)^2}$.

The correct approach is to rearrange the first equation to get $a=\frac{27}{5b^2}$, substitute this into the second equation, and solve for $b$ to get $b=\frac{3}{5}$.
