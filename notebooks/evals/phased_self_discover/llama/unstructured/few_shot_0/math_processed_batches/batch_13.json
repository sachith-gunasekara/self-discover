Number of students taking both\n= 18 + 13 - 5\n= 26\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{26}$.","trajectory":"**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\nThe problem is asking for the total number of students in the homeroom class, given that every student takes either biology, Spanish, or both.\n\n**Step 2: Organize the Information**\nLet's create a Venn diagram to organize the information:\n\n- Number of students taking biology: 18\n- Number of students taking Spanish: 13\n- Number of students taking both: 5\n\n**Step 3: Identify Overlapping Areas**\nThe overlapping area between biology and Spanish is 5 students.\n\n**Step 4: Break Down the Problem**\nLet's break down the problem into smaller parts:\n\n- Number of students taking only biology: 18 - 5 = 13\n- Number of students taking only Spanish: 13 - 5 = 8\n- Number of students taking both: 5\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the Problem from Different Perspectives**\nFrom the perspective of the total number of students, we can see that the sum of the number of students taking only biology, only Spanish, and both courses should give us the total number of students.\n\n**Step 6: Apply Principles of Inclusion-Exclusion**\nUsing the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can calculate the total number of students by adding the number of students taking only biology, only Spanish, and both courses.\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the Total Number of Students**\nTotal number of students = Number of students taking only biology + Number of students taking only Spanish + Number of students taking both\n= 13 + 8 + 5\n= 26\n\n**Step 8: Verify the Calculation**\nWe can verify the calculation by ensuring that the total number of students is equal to the sum of the number of students taking biology and the number of students taking Spanish, minus the number of students taking both courses:\nTotal number of students = Number of students taking biology + Number of students taking Spanish - Number of students taking both\n= 18 + 13 - 5\n= 26","answer_pred":"$\\boxed{26}$.","is_correct":true,"correction_reasoning":"Both the student and the reference solutions correctly identify that 5 students take both biology and Spanish, 13 students take only biology, and 8 students take only Spanish. They both use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to calculate the total number of students, which is 26. Therefore, the student's final answer is correct."}
