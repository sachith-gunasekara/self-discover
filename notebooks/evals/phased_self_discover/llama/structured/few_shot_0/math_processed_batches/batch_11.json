How can I break down the composition of functions into smaller, more manageable parts, such as substituting g(x) into f(x) and vice versa?\n10. Critical Thinking: This style involves analyzing the equation f(g(x)) = g(f(x)) from different algebraic perspectives, questioning assumptions about the functions, and evaluating the given function definitions.\n16. What is the core equation or problem that needs to be addressed, specifically what value of x satisfies f(g(x)) = g(f(x))?\n25. Is the problem a technical or practical one that requires specific algebraic expertise or skill set, such as function composition and equation solving?\n29. Is the problem an analytical one that requires algebraic manipulation, equation solving, or optimization techniques to find the value of x?\n38. Let's think step by step about how to solve the equation f(g(x)) = g(f(x)), starting with the function definitions.\n39. Let's make a step-by-step plan to solve the equation, including substituting g(x) into f(x) and vice versa, expanding and simplifying the resulting expressions, and solving for x.","reasoning_plan":"Here's a step-by-step reasoning plan in JSON format for the given task:\n\n```\n{\n    \"Step 1: Define the functions f(x) and g(x)\":\n    {\n        \"Function f(x)\": \"\",\n        \"Function g(x)\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"Step 2: Substitute g(x) into f(x) to get f(g(x))\":\n    {\n        \"Expression for f(g(x))\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"Step 3: Substitute f(x) into g(x) to get g(f(x))\":\n    {\n        \"Expression for g(f(x))\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"Step 4: Set f(g(x)) equal to g(f(x)) and simplify the equation\":\n    {\n        \"Simplified equation\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"Step 5: Solve the simplified equation for x\":\n    {\n        \"Solution for x\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"Step 6: Verify the solution by plugging it back into the original equation\":\n    {\n        \"Verification result\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"Step 7: Express the final answer as a common fraction\":\n    {\n        \"Final answer\": \"\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis reasoning plan breaks down the problem into manageable steps, allowing the solver to arrive at the correct conclusion by filling out each step.
