{"problem":"If two standard six-sided dice are tossed, what is the probability that a 5 is rolled on at least one of the two dice?

The probability of getting a 5 on the first roll is obviously $\\frac{1}{6}$, as it is on the second roll. So, the probability of getting a 5 on at least one of the rolls would appear to be $2\\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}$. But this is not quite right. We have double counted the case of rolling a 5 twice. In that instance, we have included it in both the count for a 5 on the first roll and the second roll, when it only should have been included once overall. So, our answer is $\\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{36} = \\boxed{\\frac{11}{36}}$.","self_discover_input":"Problem: If two standard six-sided dice are tossed, what is the probability that a 5 is rolled on at least one of the two dice?

interpretations?\": \"Yes, we can verify the solution by plugging it back into the system of equations.\"\n    }\n}\n```","answer_pred":"$\\boxed{174}$.","is_correct":false,"correction_reasoning":"The student's reasoning follows a different approach compared to the reference answer. The reference answer derives the values of $ab+cd$, $ac+bd$, and $ad+bc$ by adding and subtracting the given equations. It then uses the AM-GM inequality to find the minimum value of $a+b+c+d$, and subsequently the minimum value of $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2$. The student's answer, however, does not follow this approach and arrives at a different final answer. Therefore, the student's reasoning and final answer are incorrect."}
