Let the two numbers be $a$ and $b$. Then their sum is $a+b$ and their product is $ab$. The sum of their product and their sum is $a+b+ab$. So we know  \\begin{align*}\nab+a+b&=454\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\na(b+1)+(b+1)&=454+1\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n(a+1)(b+1)&=455.\n\\end{align*}The prime factorization of $455$ is $5\\cdot 7\\cdot 13$. Since the equation is symmetric with $a$ and $b$, we may (without loss of generality) suppose that $a<b$. Thus $a+1<b+1$, so in each factor pair the smaller factor is equal to $a+1$. We list all possibilities: \\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c}\n$a+1$&$b+1$&$a$&$b$\\\\ \\hline\n$1$&$455$&$0$&$454$\\\\\n$5$&$91$&$4$&$90$\\\\\n$7$&$65$&$6$&$64$\\\\\n$13$&$35$&$12$&$34$\n\\end{tabular}We must find the largest possible value of \"the product of their sum and their product\", or $ab\\cdot(a+b)$.

{"problem":"How many integers $m$ are there such that $0<m<100$ and $\\gcd(m,100)$ is a single-digit number?","level":"Level 5","type":"Number Theory","solution":"If $m$ is any integer, then $\\gcd(m,100)$ is one of the positive divisors of $100$: $$1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100.$$We note that the numbers on this list with more than one digit are all multiples of $10$, with the exception of $25$. Thus, $m$ has a single-digit $\\gcd$ with $100$ if and only if $m$ is not a multiple of either $10$ or $25$. Thus, we just need to count integers $m$ between $0$ and $100$ which are not multiples of $10$ or of $25$.\n\nThere are $99$ integers $m$ such that $0<m<100$. These include nine multiples of $10$ ($10,20,30,\\ldots,80,90$) and two more multiples of $25$ ($25$ and $75$; we don't count $50$ because we already counted it). So, that leaves $99-9-2=\\boxed{88}$ integers whose greatest common divisor with $100$ has a single digit.","self_discover_input":"Problem: How many integers $m$ are there such that $0<m<100$ and $\\gcd(m,100)$ is a single-digit number?\n\n<<<BEGIN: An example problem and solution>>>\nProblem: Convert $\\frac{3}{16}$ to base 2.
