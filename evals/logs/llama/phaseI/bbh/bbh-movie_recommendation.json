    "selected_modules": "Based on the provided task examples, the following reasoning modules are crucial for solving tasks like them:\n\n1. Critical Thinking: This style involves analyzing the problem from different perspectives, questioning assumptions, and evaluating the evidence or information available.\n2. What are the key assumptions underlying this problem?\n3. What are the alternative perspectives or viewpoints on this problem?\n4. Try creative thinking, generate innovative and out-of-the-box ideas to solve the problem.\n5. Use Reflective Thinking: Step back from the problem, take the time for introspection and self-reflection.\n6. What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed?\n7. Are there any potential solutions or strategies that have been tried before? If yes, what were the outcomes and lessons learned?\n8. What kinds of solution typically are produced for this kind of problem specification?\n9. Given the problem specification and the current best solution, have a guess about other possible solutions.\n10. Let's think step by step.\n11. Use systems thinking: Consider the problem as part of a larger system and understanding the interconnectedness of various elements.\n12. What are the underlying causes or factors contributing to the problem?",
    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. Critical Thinking: Analyze the given movie titles to identify common themes, genres, or elements that could help in finding a similar movie.\n\n2. Identify Key Assumptions: What are the underlying assumptions about the movies listed (e.g., genre, era, director, awards won)?\n\n3. Alternative Perspectives: Consider different viewpoints on what makes a movie similar to the ones listed (e.g., plot, tone, style, cast).\n\n4. Creative Thinking: Generate innovative ideas for movie similarities, such as considering movies with similar soundtracks, cinematography, or cultural impact.\n\n5. Reflective Thinking: Take a step back and reflect on the commonalities among the listed movies, and how they might relate to the options provided.\n\n6. Core Issue Identification: What is the central theme or element that ties the listed movies together?\n\n7. Previous Solutions: Have there been any previous attempts to find similar movies, and what were the outcomes?\n\n8. Typical Solutions: What kinds of movies are typically recommended as similar to the ones listed?\n\n9. Hypothetical Solutions: Given the listed movies and the current options, what other possible similar movies might exist?\n\n10. Step-by-Step Analysis: Break down the task into smaller steps, such as analyzing each listed movie individually, identifying common themes, and then comparing them to the options.\n\n11. Systems Thinking: Consider the movies as part of a larger cinematic system, and how they might be connected through various elements such as genre, director, or era.\n\n12. Causal Analysis: What underlying factors contribute to the similarities between the listed movies, and how might these factors relate to the options provided?",
