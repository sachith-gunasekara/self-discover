Here are the operationalized reasoning plans in JSON format:

**Reasoning Plan 1: Find Specific Information**
{
    Identify the primary question or objective: {
        Determine the specific information being asked:,
    },
    Filter out irrelevant information: {
        Focus on the relevant columns or rows in the table:,
    },
    Analyze the table step by step: {
        Examine each row or column to find the required information:,
    },
    Extract the required information: {
        Identify the specific data point or characteristic:,
    },
}

**Reasoning Plan 2: Compare Information**
{
    Identify the primary question or objective: {
        Determine the specific comparison being asked:,
    },
    Filter out irrelevant information: {
        Focus on the relevant columns or rows in the table:,
    },
    Break down the table into smaller parts: {
        Compare individual rows or columns:,
    },
    Identify patterns or relationships: {
        Look for sorting or comparison opportunities:,
    },
    Draw a conclusion: {
        Determine the result of the comparison:,
    },
}

**Reasoning Plan 3: Analyze and Interpret Data**
{
    Identify the primary question or objective: {
        Determine the specific analysis or interpretation required:,
    },
    Filter out irrelevant information: {
        Focus on the relevant columns or rows in the table:,
    },
    Create a plan to methodically examine the table: {
        Sort, filter, and compare data points:,
    },
    Identify patterns or relationships: {
        Look for insights into the problem:,
    },
    Draw a conclusion: {
        Determine the result of the analysis or interpretation:,
    },
}

**Reasoning Plan 4: Identify Specific Data Points**
{
    Identify the primary question or objective: {
        Determine the specific data point being asked:,
    },
    Filter out irrelevant information: {
        Focus on the relevant columns or rows in the table:,
    },
    Analyze the table step by step: {
        Examine each row or column to find the required data point:,
    },
    Extract the required data point: {
        Identify the specific characteristic:,
    },
}

**Reasoning Plan 5: Count or Quantify Data**
{
    Identify the primary question or objective: {
        Determine the specific count or quantification required:,
    },
    Filter out irrelevant information: {
        Focus on the relevant columns or rows in the table:,
    },
    Break down the table into smaller parts: {
        Count or quantify individual rows or columns:,
    },
    Identify patterns or relationships: {
        Look for opportunities to simplify the count or quantification:,
    },
    Draw a conclusion: {
        Determine the result of the count or quantification:,
    },
}
