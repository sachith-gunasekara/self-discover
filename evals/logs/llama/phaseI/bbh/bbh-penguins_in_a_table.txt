Here are the operationalized reasoning plans in JSON format:

**Reasoning Plan 1: Find the last penguin in the table**
{
    Identify the task: {
        Determine the question being asked:,
    },
    Filter out irrelevant information: {
        Focus on the penguin names:,
    },
    Analyze the table: {
        Look for the last row in the table:,
    },
    Determine the answer: {
        Identify the name of the penguin in the last row:,
    },
}

**Reasoning Plan 2: Count the number of penguins in the table**
{
    Identify the task: {
        Determine the question being asked:,
    },
    Filter out irrelevant information: {
        Focus on the number of rows in the table:,
    },
    Analyze the table: {
        Count the number of rows in the table:,
    },
    Determine the answer: {
        Identify the total count:,
    },
}

**Reasoning Plan 3: Count the number of penguins that meet a specific condition**
{
    Identify the task: {
        Determine the question being asked:,
    },
    Filter out irrelevant information: {
        Focus on the relevant column (e.g. age, weight):,
    },
    Analyze the table: {
        Compare the values in the relevant column to the condition:,
    },
    Determine the answer: {
        Count the number of rows that meet the condition:,
    },
}

**Reasoning Plan 4: Identify a penguin with a specific characteristic**
{
    Identify the task: {
        Determine the question being asked:,
    },
    Filter out irrelevant information: {
        Focus on the relevant column (e.g. name, age):,
    },
    Analyze the table: {
        Look for the row that matches the characteristic:,
    },
    Determine the answer: {
        Identify the name of the penguin that matches the characteristic:,
    },
}

**Reasoning Plan 5: Compare values in the table**
{
    Identify the task: {
        Determine the question being asked:,
    },
    Filter out irrelevant information: {
        Focus on the relevant column (e.g. height, weight):,
    },
    Analyze the table: {
        Compare the values in the relevant column:,
    },
    Determine the answer: {
        Identify the row with the maximum or minimum value:,
    },
}
