Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    "Read and Understand the Problem": {
        "Identify the key information or question being asked": {},
        "Identify the most relevant details to focus on": {}
    },
    "Break Down Complex Information": {
        "Identify the individual components or elements of the problem": {},
        "Determine how they relate to each other": {}
    },
    "Analyze the Table Structure": {
        "Identify the number of columns and rows in the table": {},
        "Determine the data type of each column": {}
    },
    "Filter and Process Data": {
        "Apply filters to the data based on the problem requirements": {},
        "Perform calculations or aggregations on the filtered data": {}
    },
    "Compare and Analyze Data": {
        "Compare data across different columns or rows": {},
        "Identify patterns or trends in the data": {}
    },
    "Draw Conclusions and Answer the Question": {
        "Use the results of the analysis to answer the question": {},
        "Select the correct answer from the options": {}
    }
}
