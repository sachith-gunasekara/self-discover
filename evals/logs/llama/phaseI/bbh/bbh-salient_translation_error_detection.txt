Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    "Step 1: Identify the source and translation texts": {
        "Read the source text in German": "",
        "Read the translation text in English": "",
        "Identify the key elements in the source text": ""
    },
    "Step 2: Compare the source and translation texts": {
        "Compare the key elements in the source text with the translation text": "",
        "Identify any discrepancies or errors in the translation text": ""
    },
    "Step 3: Analyze the error in the translation text": {
        "Determine if the error is related to a named entity": "",
        "Determine if the error is related to a numerical value": "",
        "Determine if the error is related to a modifier or adjective": "",
        "Determine if the error is related to negation or antonyms": "",
        "Determine if the error is related to a fact": "",
        "Determine if the error is related to dropped content": ""
    },
    "Step 4: Choose the correct answer option": {
        "Based on the analysis in Step 3, choose the correct answer option": "",
        "Options": ["(A) Modifiers or Adjectives", "(B) Numerical Values", "(C) Negation or Antonyms", "(D) Named Entities", "(E) Dropped Content", "(F) Facts"]
    }
}
```

This reasoning plan can be applied to all the task examples provided, and it should help solvers arrive at the correct answers.
