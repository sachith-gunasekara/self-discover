Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    Identify the core issue or discrepancy in the translation: {
        Compare the original text and the translation to identify any differences:,
    },
    Break down the translation into smaller components: {
        Identify the key phrases or sentences in the original text and the translation:,
        Compare the key phrases or sentences to identify any discrepancies:,
    },
    Analyze the translation from different linguistic and contextual perspectives: {
