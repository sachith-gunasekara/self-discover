    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. What is the core issue or discrepancy in the translation that needs to be identified?\n\n4. How can I break down the translation into smaller components to compare with the original text and simplify the error identification process?\n\n10. Critical Thinking: Analyze the translation from different linguistic and contextual perspectives, questioning assumptions about word choices, grammar, and syntax, and evaluating the evidence or information available in the original text.\n\n16. What is the key difference or inconsistency between the original text and the translation that needs to be addressed?\n\n17. What are the underlying linguistic or cultural factors contributing to the error or discrepancy in the translation?\n\n20. Are there any relevant contextual clues, such as idiomatic expressions or colloquialisms, that can provide insights into the error or discrepancy in the translation?\n\n25. Is the error or discrepancy in the translation related to a specific domain or field of expertise, such as technical or specialized terminology?\n\n30. Is the error or discrepancy in the translation related to a creative or nuanced aspect of language, such as idiomatic expressions or figurative language?\n\n38. Let's analyze the translation step by step, comparing each component with the original text to identify the error or discrepancy.",
