How can I break down this problem into smaller, more manageable parts?\n4. How can I simplify the problem so that it is easier to solve?\n9. How can I break down this problem into smaller, more manageable parts?\n10. Critical Thinking: This style involves analyzing the problem from different perspectives, questioning assumptions, and evaluating the evidence or information available.\n13. Use systems thinking: Consider the problem as part of a larger system and understanding the interconnectedness of various elements.\n16. What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed?\n25. Is the problem a technical or practical one that requires a specific expertise or skill set?\n30. Is the problem a design challenge that requires creative solutions and innovation?\n38. Let's think step by step.\n39. Let's make a step by step plan and implement it with good notion and explanation.",
    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. How can I break down this sequence into smaller, more manageable parts, focusing on one type of bracket or parenthesis at a time?\n\n4. How can I simplify the sequence by identifying and closing the innermost brackets or parentheses first?\n\n9. How can I break down this sequence into smaller, more manageable parts, using a systematic approach to match opening and closing brackets or parentheses?\n\n10. Critical Thinking: Analyze the sequence from different perspectives, such as working from the inside out or from left to right, to identify the correct order of closing brackets or parentheses.\n\n13. Use systems thinking: Consider the sequence as a system of interconnected brackets and parentheses, and understand how each part affects the overall structure.\n\n16. What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed, such as mismatched or missing brackets or parentheses?\n\n25. Is the problem a technical or practical one that requires expertise in pattern recognition or sequencing?\n\n30. Is the problem a design challenge that requires creative solutions, such as finding alternative ways to close brackets or parentheses?\n\n38. Let's think step by step, focusing on one bracket or parenthesis at a time, to ensure that the sequence is closed properly.\n\n39. Let's make a step-by-step plan, using a systematic approach to match opening and closing brackets or parentheses, and implement it with a clear and logical explanation.",
