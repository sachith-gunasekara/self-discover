Critical Thinking: This style involves analyzing the problem from different perspectives, questioning assumptions, and evaluating the evidence or information available.\n4. How can I simplify the problem so that it is easier to solve?\n10 is also known as 4 in other papers, so 4 was chosen instead of 10 to reduce redundancy.\n16. What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed?\n20. Are there any relevant data or information that can provide insights into the problem? \n25. Is the problem a technical or practical one that requires a specific expertise or skill set?\n30. Is the problem a design challenge that requires creative solutions and innovation?\n34. Given the problem specification and the current best solution, have a guess about other possible solutions.\n38. Let's think step by step.",
    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. Critical Thinking: Analyze the sentence structure and word order from different linguistic perspectives, questioning assumptions about the standard adjective order and evaluating the grammatical evidence or information available.\n\n4. Simplification: How can I break down the sentence into its individual components, such as adjectives and nouns, to make it easier to determine the correct order?\n\n10/4. Redundancy Reduction: Identify any redundant or unnecessary words in the sentence that may be affecting the adjective order, and consider alternative sentence structures that convey the same meaning.\n\n16. Core Issue Identification: What is the key aspect of the sentence that needs to be addressed in order to determine the correct adjective order?\n\n20. Data-Driven Insights: Are there any relevant linguistic rules, guidelines, or conventions that can provide insights into the correct adjective order for the given sentence?\n\n25. Technical Expertise: Does the sentence require a specific linguistic expertise or knowledge of grammatical rules to determine the correct adjective order?\n\n30. Creative Solutions: Is the sentence a linguistic design challenge that requires innovative and creative solutions to determine the correct adjective order?\n\n34. Alternative Solutions: Given the sentence structure and the current best solution, what other possible adjective orders could be considered?\n\n38. Step-by-Step Analysis: Let's analyze the sentence step by step, considering the individual words, their meanings, and their relationships to determine the correct adjective order.",
