Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    Identify the wake-up time and the closing time of the destination: {
        Extract the wake-up time from the given information:,
        Extract the closing time of the destination from the given information:,
    },
    Create a timeline of the given activities: {
        Extract the start and end times of each activity from the given information:,
        Arrange the activities in chronological order:,
    },
    Identify the gaps in the timeline: {
        Look for time slots between activities that are not occupied:,
        Identify the start and end times of each gap:,
    },
    Eliminate impossible time slots: {
        Check if any of the activities conflict with the destination:,
        Eliminate any time slots that are already occupied by conflicting activities:,
    },
    Determine the possible time range for the destination: {
        Combine the gaps in the timeline with the wake-up time and closing time:,
        Eliminate any time slots that are outside of the wake-up time and closing time:,
    },
    Select the most likely time range: {
        Compare the possible time ranges with the options provided:,
        Select the option that best matches the possible time range:,
    },
}
