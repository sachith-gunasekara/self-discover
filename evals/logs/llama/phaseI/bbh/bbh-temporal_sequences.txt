Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    Identify the wake-up time and the closing time of the location: {
        Extract the wake-up time and the closing time from the given information:,
    },
    Identify the occupied time slots: {
        Extract the time slots when the person is occupied from the given information:,
    },
    Determine the available time slots: {
        Subtract the occupied time slots from the time range between the wake-up time and the closing time:,
    },
    Analyze each available time slot: {
        Check if the location is open during each available time slot:,
    },
    Determine the possible time range: {
        Combine the available time slots when the location is open:,
    },
    Select the correct answer: {
        Match the possible time range with the given options:,
    },
}
