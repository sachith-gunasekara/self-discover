Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    Identify the person's wake-up time and the location's closing time: {
        Extract the wake-up time and the closing time from the given information:,
    },
    Create a timeline of the person's activities: {
        Break down the person's activities into separate time slots:,
    },
    Identify the gaps in between the person's activities: {
        Find the time slots when the person is not occupied:,
    },
    Eliminate the time slots when the person is known to be occupied: {
        Remove the time slots that overlap with the person's activities:,
    },
    Consider external constraints: {
        Take into account the location's operating hours:,
    },
    Analyze the remaining time slots: {
        Evaluate the feasibility of each time slot:,
    },
    Determine the most likely time slots: {
        Select the time slots that are most likely to be the correct answer:,
    },
    Compare the options: {
        Match the determined time slots with the given options:,
    },
}
```

This reasoning plan can be applied to tasks like those provided above to arrive at the correct answers.
