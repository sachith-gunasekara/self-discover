Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    "Analyze the sentence structure": {
        "Identify the adjectives in each sentence option": {},
        "Determine the type of adjectives used (e.g., quantitative, qualitative, demonstrative)": {}
    },
    "Evaluate the grammatical evidence": {
        "Consider the general rules of adjective order in English": {},
        "Assess the relationship between the adjectives and the noun": {}
    },
    "Apply the rules of adjective order": {
        "Determine the correct order based on the type of adjectives used": {
            "Quantitative adjectives (e.g., big, little)": {},
            "Qualitative adjectives (e.g., lovely, awful)": {},
            "Demonstrative adjectives (e.g., this, that)": {},
            "Possessive adjectives (e.g., my, your)": {},
            "Proper adjectives (e.g., American, Pakistani)": {},
            "Descriptive adjectives (e.g., rectangular, triangular)": {}
        },
        "Consider the order of multiple adjectives of the same type": {}
    },
    "Compare the sentence options": {
        "Evaluate each option against the determined correct adjective order": {},
        "Select the option that matches the correct adjective order": {}
    }
}
