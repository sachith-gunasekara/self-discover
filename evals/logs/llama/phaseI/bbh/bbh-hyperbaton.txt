Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    "Step 1: Critical Thinking": {
        "Analyze the sentence structure and word order from different linguistic perspectives": {},
        "Identify the adjectives and nouns in the sentence": {}
    },
    "Step 2: Simplification": {
        "Break down the sentence into its individual components, such as adjectives and nouns": {},
        "Identify the types of adjectives (e.g. opinion, size, shape, origin, material, purpose)": {}
    },
    "Step 3: Core Issue Identification": {
        "Determine the key aspect of the sentence that needs to be addressed to determine the correct adjective order": {}
    },
    "Step 4: Data-Driven Insights": {
        "Apply the standard adjective order rules (opinion, size, shape, origin, material, purpose)": {}
    },
    "Step 5: Technical Expertise": {
        "Consider any exceptions to the standard adjective order rules": {}
    },
    "Step 6: Step-by-Step Analysis": {
        "Compare the adjective order in each option to the standard adjective order rules": {},
        "Select the option that follows the standard adjective order rules": {}
    }
}
```

This reasoning plan can be applied to each of the task examples to determine the correct adjective order.
