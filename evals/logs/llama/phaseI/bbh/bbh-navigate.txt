Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    "Step 1: Break down the instructions into individual movements": {
        "Identify each movement in the instructions": [],
        "Record the direction and magnitude of each movement": []
    },
    "Step 2: Analyze the effect of each movement on the overall position": {
        "Determine the change in position caused by each movement": [],
        "Consider any turns or changes in direction": []
    },
    "Step 3: Combine or cancel out opposing movements": {
        "Identify any pairs of movements that cancel each other out": [],
        "Combine any movements that are in the same direction": []
    },
    "Step 4: Determine the final position": {
        "Calculate the net change in position caused by all movements": [],
        "Consider the starting point and any turns or changes in direction": []
    },
    "Step 5: Determine if the starting point is returned to": {
        "Compare the final position to the starting point": [],
        "If the final position is the same as the starting point, return 'Yes'": [],
        "Otherwise, return 'No'": []
    }
}
```

This reasoning plan can be applied to each of the task examples to determine if the starting point is returned to.
