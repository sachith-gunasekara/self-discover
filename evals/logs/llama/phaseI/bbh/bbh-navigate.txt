Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    "Analyze the instructions": {
        "Break down the instructions into individual steps": {},
        "Identify the direction and number of steps for each instruction": {}
    },
    "Track the movements": {
        "Initialize the current position to the starting point": {},
        "For each instruction": {
            "Update the current position based on the direction and number of steps": {}
        }
    },
    "Evaluate the cumulative effect": {
        "Calculate the net displacement in the x and y directions": {},
        "Check if the net displacement is zero in both directions": {}
    },
    "Determine if the instructions lead back to the starting point": {
        "If the net displacement is zero in both directions, return Yes": {},
        "Otherwise, return No": {}
    }
}
```

Alternatively, a more detailed structure can be used:

```
{
    "Initialize variables": {
        "Set the initial x and y coordinates to 0": {},
        "Set the initial direction to forward": {}
    },
    "For each instruction": {
        "If the instruction is to move forward or backward": {
            "Update the x coordinate based on the direction and number of steps": {}
        },
        "If the instruction is to move left or right": {
            "Update the y coordinate based on the direction and number of steps": {}
        },
        "If the instruction is to turn around or change direction": {
            "Update the direction": {}
        }
    },
    "Calculate the net displacement": {
        "Calculate the final x and y coordinates": {},
        "Calculate the net displacement in the x and y directions": {}
    },
    "Determine if the instructions lead back to the starting point": {
        "If the net displacement is zero in both directions, return Yes": {},
        "Otherwise, return No": {}
    }
}
```
