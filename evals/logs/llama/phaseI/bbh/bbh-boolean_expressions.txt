Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    "Step 1: Simplify the Expression": {
        "Apply the NOT operator to the innermost parentheses": {},
        "Remove unnecessary parentheses": {},
        "Apply logical equivalences (e.g., NOT NOT A = A)": {}
    },
    "Step 2: Evaluate the Innermost Expressions": {
        "Evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses": {},
        "Apply the logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) to the evaluated expressions": {}
    },
    "Step 3: Apply the Order of Operations": {
        "Apply the logical operators from left to right": {},
        "Follow the order of operations (NOT, AND, OR)": {}
    },
    "Step 4: Simplify the Expression Further": {
        "Combine like terms": {},
        "Remove any remaining unnecessary parentheses": {}
    },
    "Step 5: Evaluate the Final Expression": {
        "Apply the logical operators to the simplified expression": {},
        "Determine the final value of the expression": {}
    }
}
```

This reasoning plan can be applied to all the task examples provided, and it should lead to the correct answers. The plan involves simplifying the expression, evaluating the innermost expressions, applying the order of operations, simplifying the expression further, and finally evaluating the final expression.
