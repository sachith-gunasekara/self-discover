Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    "Step 1: Simplify the Statement": {
        "Apply Simplification Module": "Remove any redundant or unnecessary operators or components in the statement"
    },
    "Step 2: Identify Operators and Precedence": {
        "Apply Critical Thinking Module": "Identify the operators (and, or, not) and their precedence in the statement"
    },
    "Step 3: Evaluate Innermost Parentheses": {
        "Apply Step-by-Step Analysis Module": "Evaluate the innermost parentheses or operators first"
    },
    "Step 4: Apply Logical Rules": {
        "Apply Analytical Thinking Module": "Apply logical rules and truth tables to analyze the statement"
    },
    "Step 5: Evaluate Truth Values": {
        "Apply Core Issue Identification Module": "Identify the key components of the statement that determine its overall truth value"
    },
    "Step 6: Combine Truth Values": {
        "Apply Decomposition Module": "Combine the truth values of each sub-statement to determine the overall truth value"
    },
    "Step 7: Final Evaluation": {
        "Apply Systems Thinking Module": "Consider the statement as a system of interconnected components and analyze how the truth values of each component affect the overall system"
    }
}
```

This operationalized reasoning plan can be applied to tasks like the examples provided to arrive at the correct answers.
