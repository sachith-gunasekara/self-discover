    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. Critical Thinking: Analyze the given date information, identify the relevant details, and evaluate the relationships between them to determine the correct date.\n\n4. Simplification: Break down complex date calculations into simpler components, such as identifying the day of the week or the number of days in a month.\n\n9. Problem Decomposition: Divide the problem into smaller parts, such as determining the current date, calculating the date one year ago, or identifying the day of the week.\n\n16. Core Issue Identification: Identify the key issue in the problem, such as determining the date one year ago or calculating the date based on a specific event.\n\n17. Causal Analysis: Identify the underlying factors that affect the date, such as the day of the week, the month, or the year.\n\n20. Data Analysis: Identify relevant data sources, such as calendars or date conversion tools, and analyze them to gain insights into the problem.\n\n25. Expertise Identification: Determine if the problem requires specific knowledge or skills, such as understanding date formatting conventions or calculating dates based on events.\n\n38. Step-by-Step Thinking: Break down the problem into a series of logical steps, such as identifying the current date, calculating the date one year ago, and determining the correct format.\n\n39. Step-by-Step Planning: Create a plan to solve the problem, including identifying the necessary steps, determining the relevant information, and executing the plan to arrive at the correct answer.",
