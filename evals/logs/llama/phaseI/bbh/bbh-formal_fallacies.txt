Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    "Step 1: Analyze the argument's logical structure": {
        "Identify the premises and conclusion": {},
        "Determine the relationships between the premises and conclusion": {}
    },
    "Step 2: Break down complex arguments into smaller parts": {
        "Identify the essential elements that affect the conclusion": {}
    },
    "Step 3: Identify unstated assumptions and implicit premises": {
        "Assess their impact on the conclusion": {}
    },
    "Step 4: Evaluate the argument's validity": {
        "Check for logical fallacies, inconsistencies, and ambiguities": {}
    },
    "Step 5: Consider the argument as part of a larger logical system": {
        "Analyze how the different components interact and affect the conclusion": {}
    },
    "Step 6: Identify the central claim or problem": {
        "Evaluate how well the premises support it": {}
    },
    "Step 7: Determine the type of argument": {
        "Technical or practical issue, or conceptual or theoretical problem": {}
    },
    "Step 8: Evaluate the logical connections between each step": {
        "Ensure that the conclusion follows from the premises": {}
    },
    "Step 9: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis": {
        "Determine if the argument is deductively valid or invalid": {}
    }
}
```

This reasoning structure can be applied to tasks like those provided above to arrive at correct answers.
