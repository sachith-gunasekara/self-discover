Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
  "Determine Argument Validity": {
    "Step 1: Identify Premises and Conclusion": {
      "Identify the premises and conclusion of the argument",
      "Break down the argument into its component parts"
    },
    "Step 2: Analyze Argument Structure": {
      "Determine the logical structure of the argument",
      "Identify any flaws or biases that may affect the argument's validity"
    },
    "Step 3: Evaluate Premises": {
      "Evaluate the truth and relevance of each premise",
      "Determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premises"
    },
    "Step 4: Check for Assumptions": {
      "Identify any underlying assumptions in the argument",
      "Determine if the assumptions are valid and supported by evidence"
    },
    "Step 5: Consider Alternative Perspectives": {
      "Consider alternative explanations or solutions that may challenge the argument's conclusion or assumptions",
      "Evaluate the validity of the alternative perspectives"
    },
    "Step 6: Evaluate Conclusion": {
      "Assess the conclusion's validity based on the premises and the argument's logical structure",
      "Determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premises"
    },
    "Step 7: Determine Validity": {
      "Apply established criteria for deductive validity, such as soundness and completeness",
      "Determine if the argument is deductively valid or invalid"
    }
  }
}
```

This reasoning plan provides a step-by-step structure for evaluating the validity of an argument. It includes steps for identifying premises and conclusions, analyzing argument structure, evaluating premises, checking for assumptions, considering alternative perspectives, evaluating conclusions, and determining validity. This plan can be applied to a wide range of argument evaluation tasks, including those provided in the task examples.
