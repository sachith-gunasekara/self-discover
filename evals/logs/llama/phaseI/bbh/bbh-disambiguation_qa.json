Critical Thinking: This style involves analyzing the problem from different perspectives, questioning assumptions, and evaluating the evidence or information available.\n4. How can I simplify the problem so that it is easier to solve?\n10 is a duplicate of 1, so it is not selected.\n16. What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed?\n17. What are the underlying causes or factors contributing to the problem?\n25. Is the problem a technical or practical one that requires a specific expertise or skill set? Or is it more of a conceptual or theoretical problem?\n30. Is the problem a design challenge that requires creative solutions and innovation?\n38. Let's think step by step.",
    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. Critical Thinking: Analyze the sentence structure, word order, and pronoun placement to identify potential ambiguities and evaluate the relationships between entities.\n\n4. Simplification: Break down complex sentences into simpler components to isolate the pronoun and its potential antecedents, making it easier to identify the correct relationship.\n\n16. Core Issue Identification: Identify the pronoun and its potential antecedents, and determine the core issue of resolving the ambiguity in the sentence.\n\n17. Causal Analysis: Examine the relationships between entities in the sentence, considering factors such as verb tense, subject-verb agreement, and contextual clues to determine the most likely antecedent.\n\n25. Expertise Evaluation: Recognize that resolving pronoun ambiguity often requires linguistic expertise, including knowledge of grammar, syntax, and semantics.\n\n30. Creative Solutioning: Consider alternative sentence structures or wordings that could clarify the pronoun's antecedent, and evaluate the impact of different interpretations on the sentence's meaning.\n\n38. Step-by-Step Analysis: Systematically analyze the sentence, starting with the pronoun and working backward to identify potential antecedents, and then evaluating the relationships between entities to determine the most likely interpretation.",
