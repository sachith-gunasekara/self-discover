Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    Identify the key causal relationships and interactions underlying the problem: {
        Determine the cause and effect variables:,
        Identify any intermediate variables or events that may influence the outcome:,
        Consider any relevant rules, policies, or norms that may impact the causal relationships:,
    },
    Simplify the causal chain of events: {
        Identify the most direct causal link between the cause and effect variables:,
        Eliminate any unnecessary or redundant variables or events:,
        Focus on the key causal relationships and interactions:,
    },
    Identify key assumptions about causality and responsibility: {
        Consider the role of human agency and intentionality:,
        Evaluate the impact of external factors or circumstances:,
        Assess the degree of control or influence exerted by each variable or event:,
    },
    Analyze alternative perspectives or viewpoints on causality and responsibility: {
        Consider multiple stakeholders or actors involved in the situation:,
        Evaluate the potential biases or motivations of each stakeholder:,
        Assess the implications of different causal attributions or responsibility assignments:,
    },
    Apply critical thinking and systems thinking: {
        Evaluate the evidence or information available:,
        Consider the broader system or context in which the causal relationships operate:,
        Assess the potential consequences or outcomes of different causal attributions or actions:,
    },
    Determine the core causal issue or problem: {
        Identify the key causal question or problem to be addressed:,
        Evaluate the relevance and importance of the causal issue:,
        Assess the potential impact or consequences of resolving the causal issue:,
    },
    Identify the underlying causes or factors contributing to the outcome: {
        Consider the role of multiple variables or events:,
        Evaluate the interactions and interdependencies between variables or events:,
        Assess the relative importance or contribution of each variable or event:,
    },
    Evaluate the causal relationships and interactions: {
        Consider the direction and strength of the causal relationships:,
        Evaluate the potential for reverse causality or feedback loops:,
        Assess the robustness and reliability of the causal relationships:,
    },
    Draw a conclusion about causality and responsibility: {
        Based on the analysis, determine the most likely cause of the outcome:,
        Evaluate the degree of responsibility or agency attributed to each variable or event:,
        Consider the implications and potential consequences of the causal attribution:,
    },
