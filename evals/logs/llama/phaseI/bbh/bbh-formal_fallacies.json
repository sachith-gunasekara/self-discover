    "selected_modules": "Based on the task examples provided, the following reasoning modules are crucial for solving tasks like them:\n\n1. Critical Thinking: This style involves analyzing the problem from different perspectives, questioning assumptions, and evaluating the evidence or information available.\n4. How can I simplify the problem so that it is easier to solve?\n5. What are the key assumptions underlying this problem?\n10. Critical Thinking: This style involves analyzing the problem from different perspectives, questioning assumptions, and evaluating the evidence or information available.\n13. Use systems thinking: Consider the problem as part of a larger system and understanding the interconnectedness of various elements.\n16. What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed?\n25. Is the problem a technical or practical one that requires a specific expertise or skill set? Or is it more of a conceptual or theoretical problem?\n30. Is the problem a design challenge that requires creative solutions and innovation?\n34. Given the problem specification and the current best solution, have a guess about other possible solutions.\n35. Let's imagine the current best solution is totally wrong, what other ways are there to think about the problem specification?\n38. Let's think step by step.",
    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. Critical Thinking: Analyze the argument's logical structure, identify the premises and conclusion, and evaluate the relationships between them.\n\n4. Simplification: Break down complex arguments into smaller, manageable parts, and identify the essential elements that affect the conclusion.\n\n5. Assumption Identification: Recognize unstated assumptions and implicit premises that underlie the argument, and assess their impact on the conclusion.\n\n10. Critical Thinking: Evaluate the argument's validity by checking for logical fallacies, inconsistencies, and ambiguities.\n\n13. Systems Thinking: Consider the argument as part of a larger logical system, and analyze how the different components interact and affect the conclusion.\n\n16. Core Issue Identification: Identify the central claim or problem that the argument is trying to address, and evaluate how well the premises support it.\n\n25. Problem Categorization: Determine whether the argument is based on a technical or practical issue, or if it is a conceptual or theoretical problem, and adjust your analysis accordingly.\n\n30. Design Challenge: Recognize when an argument requires creative solutions or innovative thinking, and be willing to consider alternative perspectives and approaches.\n\n34. Alternative Solution Generation: Think of alternative explanations or solutions that could also be valid, and evaluate how they compare to the original argument.\n\n35. Contrarian Thinking: Imagine that the original argument is incorrect, and think of alternative explanations or solutions that could be valid instead.\n\n38. Step-by-Step Analysis: Break down the argument into smaller steps, and evaluate the logical connections between each step to ensure that the conclusion follows from the premises.",
