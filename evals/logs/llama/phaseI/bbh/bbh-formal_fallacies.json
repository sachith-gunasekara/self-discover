    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. Critical Thinking: Analyze the argument from different perspectives, questioning assumptions and evaluating the evidence or information available to determine deductive validity.\n\n4. Simplification: Identify the key elements of the argument and simplify the problem by breaking it down into manageable parts to facilitate analysis.\n\n5. Assumption Identification: Identify the underlying assumptions in the argument, including implicit premises, to ensure that the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n10. Critical Thinking: Evaluate the argument's logical structure, identifying any flaws or biases that may affect its validity.\n\n16. Core Issue Identification: Determine the central claim or conclusion of the argument and identify the key issues that need to be addressed to evaluate its validity.\n\n17. Causal Analysis: Identify the underlying causes or factors contributing to the argument's conclusion, including any implicit or explicit assumptions.\n\n25. Expertise Evaluation: Determine if the argument requires specialized knowledge or expertise to evaluate its validity, and consider the potential limitations of one's own knowledge or biases.\n\n30. Creative Solution Evaluation: Consider alternative perspectives or creative solutions that may challenge the argument's conclusion or assumptions.\n\n34. Alternative Solution Generation: Generate alternative explanations or solutions that may be consistent with the premises but lead to a different conclusion.\n\n38. Step-by-Step Analysis: Break down the argument into its component parts and evaluate each step logically to determine the validity of the conclusion.\n\nAdditional adapted modules:\n\n- Argument Mapping: Create a visual representation of the argument to illustrate the relationships between premises and conclusions.\n- Premise Evaluation: Evaluate the truth and relevance of each premise to determine if the conclusion logically follows.\n- Conclusion Evaluation: Assess the conclusion's validity based on the premises and the argument's logical structure.\n- Counterexample Generation: Attempt to find counterexamples that challenge the argument's conclusion or assumptions.\n- Validity Criteria Evaluation: Apply established criteria for deductive validity, such as soundness and completeness, to evaluate the argument's validity.",
