    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. Critical Thinking: Analyze the given statements from different perspectives, identify the relationships between objects, and evaluate the evidence to determine the correct order or position of objects.\n\n4. Simplification: Identify the key information and eliminate irrelevant details to simplify the problem and make it easier to visualize the order or position of objects.\n\n9. Problem Decomposition: Break down the problem into smaller parts, such as individual statements or relationships between objects, to better understand the overall order or position of objects.\n\n16. Core Issue Identification: Identify the central question or issue, such as determining the order or position of objects, and focus on resolving that issue.\n\n17. Causal Analysis: Identify the underlying relationships and constraints between objects, such as \"A is older than B\" or \"C is to the left of D\", to understand the causal structure of the problem.\n\n25. Expertise Identification: Recognize that these problems require logical reasoning and spatial reasoning skills, rather than specific domain expertise.\n\n30. Design Challenge: View the problem as a design challenge, where the goal is to construct a coherent and logical order or arrangement of objects that satisfies all the given constraints.\n\n38. Step-by-Step Reasoning: Approach the problem in a systematic and step-by-step manner, using logical deductions and inferences to build up a solution.\n\n39. Step-by-Step Planning: Create a plan to tackle the problem, breaking it down into manageable steps, and execute that plan to arrive at a solution, using good notation and explanation to support the reasoning.",
