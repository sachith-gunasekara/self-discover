Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    "Assess Plausibility": {
        "Step 1: Identify Contextual Assumptions": {
            "Identify the sport, league, and position mentioned in the statement": {},
            "Consider how these assumptions affect the plausibility of the statement": {}
        },
        "Step 2: Simplify the Statement": {
            "Identify the key elements (e.g. player, action, event) in the statement": {},
            "Analyze each element separately to assess its plausibility": {}
        },
        "Step 3: Analyze from Different Perspectives": {
            "Consider the player's typical behavior and team's strategy": {},
            "Question assumptions about the sport or event": {},
            "Evaluate available information about the player and event": {}
        },
        "Step 4: Identify Core Issue or Problem": {
            "Determine if there is an inconsistency with the player's typical behavior": {},
            "Check for mismatch between the action and the sport": {}
        },
        "Step 5: Consider Relevant Data or Information": {
            "Identify relevant data sources (e.g. player statistics, team records, sports rules)": {},
            "Analyze the data to provide insights into the plausibility of the statement": {}
        },
        "Step 6: Assess Technical or Practical Aspects": {
            "Determine if the statement requires specific expertise or knowledge": {},
            "Consider if the statement is related to a technical or practical aspect of the sport": {}
        },
        "Step 7: Consider Alternative Explanations": {
            "Guess other possible explanations or interpretations that could affect plausibility": {}
        },
        "Step 8: Break Down the Statement": {
            "Break down the statement into individual components (e.g. player, action, event)": {},
            "Analyze each component step by step to assess its plausibility": {}
        },
        "Step 9: Make a Final Assessment": {
            "Based on the analysis, determine if the statement is plausible or not": {}
        }
    }
