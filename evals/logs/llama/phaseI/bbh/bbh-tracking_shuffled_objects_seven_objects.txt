Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    Initialize the state of the system: {
        Record the initial state of each entity (e.g., person, ball, book, partner):,
    },
    Track changes to the state of the system: {
        Iterate through each swap or switch: {
            Identify the entities involved in the swap or switch:,
            Update the state of each entity to reflect the swap or switch:,
        },
    },
    Determine the final state of a specific entity: {
        Identify the entity of interest:,
        Report the final state of the entity:,
    },
}
```

Alternatively, a more detailed reasoning plan:

```
{
    Initialize the state of the system: {
        Create a dictionary or table to store the state of each entity:,
        Record the initial state of each entity in the dictionary or table:,
    },
    Track changes to the state of the system: {
        Iterate through each swap or switch: {
            Identify the entities involved in the swap or switch:,
            Swap the states of the entities in the dictionary or table:,
        },
    },
    Determine the final state of a specific entity: {
        Identify the entity of interest:,
        Look up the final state of the entity in the dictionary or table:,
        Report the final state of the entity:,
    },
}
```

This reasoning plan can be applied to a wide range of tasks involving sequential swaps or switches, including the task examples provided.
