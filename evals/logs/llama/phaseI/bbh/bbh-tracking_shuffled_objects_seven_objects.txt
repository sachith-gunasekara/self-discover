Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    Initialize the state of the problem: {
        Create a dictionary to store the initial assignments of items to people:,
    },
    Track the sequence of swaps: {
        Iterate over each swap in the sequence: {
            Update the dictionary to reflect the swap:,
        },
    },
    Determine the final assignment of an item to a person: {
        Look up the final assignment in the dictionary:,
    },
    Determine the final assignment of a person to an item: {
        Iterate over the dictionary to find the person's final assignment:,
    },
}
```

Alternatively, a more detailed structure can be used:

```
{
    Initialize the state of the problem: {
        Create a dictionary to store the initial assignments of items to people:,
        Create a list to store the sequence of swaps:,
    },
    Track the sequence of swaps: {
        Iterate over each swap in the sequence: {
            Identify the people and items involved in the swap:,
            Update the dictionary to reflect the swap:,
        },
    },
    Determine the final assignment of an item to a person: {
        Look up the final assignment in the dictionary:,
    },
    Determine the final assignment of a person to an item: {
        Iterate over the dictionary to find the person's final assignment:,
    },
    Analyze the sequence of swaps: {
        Identify any patterns or structures in the sequence:,
        Consider alternative sequences of swaps:,
    },
}
```

Or, an even more detailed structure:

```
{
    Initialize the state of the problem: {
        Create a dictionary to store the initial assignments of items to people:,
        Create a list to store the sequence of swaps:,
        Create a set to store the people involved in the swaps:,
        Create a set to store the items involved in the swaps:,
    },
    Track the sequence of swaps: {
        Iterate over each swap in the sequence: {
            Identify the people and items involved in the swap:,
            Update the dictionary to reflect the swap:,
            Update the sets of people and items involved in the swaps:,
        },
    },
    Determine the final assignment of an item to a person: {
        Look up the final assignment in the dictionary:,
    },
    Determine the final assignment of a person to an item: {
        Iterate over the dictionary to find the person's final assignment:,
    },
    Analyze the sequence of swaps: {
        Identify any patterns or structures in the sequence:,
        Consider alternative sequences of swaps:,
        Evaluate the impact of each swap on the final assignments:,
    },
    Draw conclusions: {
        Summarize the final assignments of items to people:,
        Summarize the final assignments of people to items:,
    },
}
