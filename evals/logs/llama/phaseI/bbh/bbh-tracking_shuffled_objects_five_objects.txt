Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    Initialize the state of each entity: {
        Record the initial state of each entity and its associated property:,
    },
    Break down the sequence of actions: {
        Identify each action and its impact on the entities and their properties:,
    },
    Track changes and updates: {
        Create a systematic plan to update the state of each entity after each action:,
    },
    Analyze the sequence of actions: {
        Iterate through each action and update the state of each entity accordingly:,
    },
    Determine the final state of the target entity: {
        After all actions have been applied, determine the final state of the target entity:,
    },
}
```

This reasoning plan can be applied to tasks like those provided above, where a sequence of actions affects the state of entities and their properties. By following this plan, solvers can arrive at the correct answer by tracking the changes and updates to each entity's state.
