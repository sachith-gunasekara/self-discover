Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    Identify the initial state: {
        Record the initial positions or possessions of each person or item:,
    },
    Break down the sequence of events: {
        List the swaps or trades in the order they occur:,
    },
    Create a notation system: {
        Assign a variable or symbol to each person or item:,
    },
    Track the updates: {
        Iterate through the sequence of events and update the notation system after each swap or trade:,
    },
    Analyze the final state: {
        Use the notation system to determine the final position or possession of the person or item in question:,
    },
    Determine the answer: {
        Match the final state to the available options and select the correct answer:,
    },
}
```

This reasoning structure can be applied to all the task examples provided, and it should lead to the correct answer in each case.
