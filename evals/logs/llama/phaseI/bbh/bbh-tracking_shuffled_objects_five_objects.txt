Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    "Track Initial State": {
        "Identify the initial positions or objects held by each person": {},
        "Record the initial state in a table or diagram": {}
    },
    "Break Down Sequence of Events": {
        "Identify each swap or trade in the sequence of events": {},
        "Record each swap or trade in a table or diagram": {}
    },
    "Apply Sequence of Events": {
        "Apply each swap or trade to the initial state": {},
        "Update the table or diagram after each swap or trade": {}
    },
    "Simplify Sequence of Events (Optional)": {
        "Identify any patterns or cycles in the sequence of events": {},
        "Simplify the sequence of events by focusing on key changes or swaps": {}
    },
    "Determine Final State": {
        "Use the updated table or diagram to determine the final position or object held by the person in question": {}
    },
    "Select Correct Answer": {
        "Compare the final state to the answer options": {},
        "Select the correct answer": {}
    }
}
```

This reasoning plan can be applied to tasks like those provided above, where a sequence of events (swaps or trades) affects the positions or objects held by a group of people. By following this plan, solvers can track the changes and arrive at the correct answer.
