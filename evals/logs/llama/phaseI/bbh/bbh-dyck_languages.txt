Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    Initialize an empty stack to store opening parentheses: {},
    Iterate through the input sequence from left to right: {
        If the current character is an opening parenthesis: {
            Push the opening parenthesis onto the stack:,
        },
        If the current character is a closing parenthesis: {
            Check the top of the stack for the corresponding opening parenthesis: {
                If the top of the stack matches the current closing parenthesis: {
                    Pop the opening parenthesis from the stack:,
                },
                If the top of the stack does not match the current closing parenthesis: {
                    Identify the correct closing parenthesis for the top of the stack:,
                    Add the correct closing parenthesis to the sequence before the current closing parenthesis:,
                    Pop the opening parenthesis from the stack:,
                },
            },
        },
    },
    After iterating through the entire sequence: {
        If the stack is not empty: {
            Add the corresponding closing parentheses to the end of the sequence:,
        },
    },
    Return the completed sequence with properly closed parentheses:,
}
```
