    "selected_modules": "Here are the selected reasoning modules:\n\n1. Let's think step by step.\n2. Let's make a step by step plan and implement it with good notion and explanation.\n3. Try creative thinking, generate innovative and out-of-the-box ideas to solve the problem. Explore unconventional solutions, thinking beyond traditional boundaries, and encouraging imagination and originality.\n4. What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed?\n5. How can I break down this problem into smaller, more manageable parts?\n6. Critical Thinking: This style involves analyzing the problem from different perspectives, questioning assumptions, and evaluating the evidence or information available. It focuses on logical reasoning, evidence-based decision-making, and identifying potential biases or flaws in thinking.\n9. What kinds of solution typically are produced for this kind of problem specification?\n38. Given the problem specification and the current best solution, have a guess about other possible solutions.\n39. Ignoring the current best solution, create an entirely new solution to the problem.",
    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. Let's track the sequence of events step by step to understand how the initial situation changes over time.\n\n2. Create a systematic plan to update the information after each swap or switch, ensuring that all changes are accounted for and accurately reflected in the final outcome.\n\n3. Consider unconventional ways to represent the information, such as diagrams or charts, to help visualize the changes and identify patterns or connections that might lead to the solution.\n\n4. Identify the key elements that are being swapped or switched, and focus on how these changes affect the specific person or item in question.\n\n5. Break down the problem into smaller parts by analyzing each swap or switch individually, and then combine the results to determine the final outcome.\n\n6. Analyze the problem from different perspectives, such as focusing on a specific person or item, or considering the overall pattern of swaps or switches, to identify potential biases or flaws in thinking.\n\n9. Consider the types of solutions that typically arise from problems involving sequential swaps or switches, and use this knowledge to inform the solution.\n\n38. Based on the pattern of swaps or switches, make an educated guess about other possible solutions or outcomes.\n\n39. Ignore the given sequence of swaps or switches, and instead try to find an alternative sequence that leads to the same final outcome, or simply try to deduce the final state directly.",
