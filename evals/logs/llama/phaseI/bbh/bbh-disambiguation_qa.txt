Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    Identify the pronoun and its position in the sentence: {
        Locate the pronoun in the sentence and note its position:,
    },
    Identify the potential antecedents of the pronoun: {
        List the nouns in the sentence that could potentially be the antecedent of the pronoun:,
    },
    Analyze the sentence structure: {
        Break down the sentence into its constituent parts (subject, verb, object):,
    },
    Determine the relationships between entities: {
        Identify the relationships between the potential antecedents and the pronoun:,
    },
    Consider the context: {
        Take into account the context in which the sentence is being used:,
    },
    Evaluate the options: {
        Compare the potential antecedents with the options provided:,
    },
    Make a decision: {
        Choose the option that best matches the antecedent of the pronoun, or determine that it is ambiguous:,
    },
}
```

This reasoning plan can be applied to tasks like those provided, where the goal is to identify the antecedent of a pronoun in a sentence.
