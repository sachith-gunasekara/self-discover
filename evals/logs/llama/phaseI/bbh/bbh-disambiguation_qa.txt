Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    "Step 1: Analyze Sentence Structure": {
        "Break down the sentence into simpler components": {},
        "Identify the pronoun and its potential antecedents": {}
    },
    "Step 2: Identify Assumptions": {
        "Recognize assumptions about the pronoun's antecedent based on sentence structure and word order": {},
        "Evaluate the validity of these assumptions": {}
    },
    "Step 3: Evaluate Contextual Clues": {
        "Consider the relationships between words, phrases, and clauses": {},
        "Determine the most likely antecedent of the pronoun based on contextual clues": {}
    },
    "Step 4: Consider Alternative Interpretations": {
        "Evaluate multiple possible interpretations of the pronoun's antecedent": {},
        "Determine if the pronoun's antecedent is ambiguous": {}
    },
    "Step 5: Draw Conclusion": {
        "Based on the analysis, identify the antecedent of the pronoun or state that it is ambiguous": {}
    }
}
