Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    "Step 1: Critical Thinking": {
        "Analyze the sentence structure": {},
        "Identify potential ambiguities": {},
        "Evaluate the relationships between entities": {}
    },
    "Step 2: Core Issue Identification": {
        "Identify the pronoun": {},
        "Identify potential antecedents": {},
        "Determine the core issue of resolving the ambiguity": {}
    },
    "Step 3: Simplification": {
        "Break down complex sentences into simpler components": {},
        "Isolate the pronoun and its potential antecedents": {}
    },
    "Step 4: Causal Analysis": {
        "Examine the relationships between entities": {},
        "Consider verb tense, subject-verb agreement, and contextual clues": {},
        "Determine the most likely antecedent": {}
    },
    "Step 5: Expertise Evaluation": {
        "Recognize the need for linguistic expertise": {},
        "Apply knowledge of grammar, syntax, and semantics": {}
    },
    "Step 6: Step-by-Step Analysis": {
        "Systematically analyze the sentence": {},
        "Start with the pronoun and work backward": {},
        "Evaluate the relationships between entities": {}
    },
    "Step 7: Conclusion": {
        "Determine the antecedent of the pronoun": {},
        "State the answer or indicate ambiguity": {}
    }
}
