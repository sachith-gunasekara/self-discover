Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    "Step 1: Analyze the given statements": {
        "Identify the objects and their relationships": {
            "Extract the objects mentioned in the statements": [],
            "Determine the relationships between the objects (e.g., more expensive, to the left, etc.)": []
        }
    },
    "Step 2: Simplify the problem": {
        "Eliminate any irrelevant information": [],
        "Focus on the key elements of the problem": []
    },
    "Step 3: Identify the central question or problem": {
        "Determine the main question being asked (e.g., which object is the cheapest, etc.)": []
    },
    "Step 4: Analyze the relationships between the objects": {
        "Use the relationships identified in Step 1 to determine the order or ranking of the objects": []
    },
    "Step 5: Draw a conclusion": {
        "Based on the analysis in Step 4, determine the correct answer to the central question or problem": []
    },
    "Step 6: Verify the answer": {
        "Check that the answer is consistent with the given statements and relationships": []
    }
}
