Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    "Critical Thinking": {
        "Analyze the given statements": {
            "Identify the key information": {},
            "Evaluate the logical consistency": {}
        }
    },
    "Simplification": {
        "Eliminate irrelevant details": {},
        "Focus on key relationships": {}
    },
    "Problem Decomposition": {
        "Identify individual objects": {},
        "Identify relationships between objects": {},
        "Identify given constraints": {}
    },
    "Core Issue Identification": {
        "Determine the central question": {}
    },
    "Problem Categorization": {
        "Recognize problem type": {
            "Technical or practical": {},
            "Conceptual or theoretical": {}
        }
    },
    "Step-by-Step Analysis": {
        "Analyze given information": {},
        "Identify key relationships": {},
        "Use logical deductions": {}
    },
    "Step-by-Step Planning": {
        "Develop a systematic plan": {
            "Analyze the problem": {},
            "Identify key information": {},
            "Use logical reasoning": {}
        },
        "Implement the plan": {
            "Provide clear explanations": {},
            "Provide justifications": {}
        }
    },
    "Arrive at a Conclusion": {
        "Use logical deductions": {},
        "Answer the central question": {}
    }
}
```

However, the above structure may be too general and may not be directly applicable to the specific task examples provided. Here is a more specific operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    "Identify the objects and their relationships": {
        "Extract the objects": {},
        "Extract the relationships": {}
    },
    "Determine the order or relationship": {
        "Use logical deductions": {},
        "Apply the relationships to the objects": {}
    },
    "Eliminate impossible options": {
        "Compare the determined order or relationship to the options": {},
        "Eliminate options that are inconsistent": {}
    },
    "Select the correct answer": {
        "Choose the option that is consistent with the determined order or relationship": {}
    }
}
```

This structure can be applied to the task examples provided, and can help solvers arrive at the correct answers.
