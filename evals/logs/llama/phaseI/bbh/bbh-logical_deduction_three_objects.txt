Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    "Determine the core relationship or ordering": {
        "Identify the objects and their relationships": {},
        "Determine the type of relationship (e.g., spatial, temporal, causal)": {}
    },
    "Break down the given information": {
        "Identify the individual statements": {},
        "Analyze each statement to determine the relationships between objects": {}
    },
    "Analyze the statements from different perspectives": {
        "Question any assumptions": {},
        "Evaluate the evidence to determine the correct ordering or relationship": {}
    },
    "Identify the key information or statement": {
        "Determine the statement that provides the most insight into the correct ordering or relationship": {}
    },
    "Determine the underlying relationships or constraints": {
        "Identify any rules or patterns that govern the ordering of the objects": {}
    },
    "Look for relevant clues or statements": {
        "Identify any additional information that provides insight into the correct ordering or relationship": {}
    },
    "Determine the type of problem": {
        "Decide if the problem is a logical or spatial reasoning challenge": {},
        "Decide if the problem is a pattern recognition or sequencing challenge": {}
    },
    "Create a step-by-step plan": {
        "Evaluate the given statements": {},
        "Identify the key relationships": {},
        "Determine the correct ordering or relationship": {}
    },
    "Draw a conclusion": {
        "Use the analysis to determine the correct answer": {}
    }
}
```

Here is a more specific operationalized reasoning plan for the given task examples:

```
{
    "Identify the objects and their relationships": {
        "Determine the three objects being compared": {},
        "Identify the relationships between the objects (e.g., newer/older, more/less expensive, above/below)": {}
    },
    "Analyze the individual statements": {
        "Statement 1: Object A is [relationship] to Object B": {},
        "Statement 2: Object B is [relationship] to Object C": {}
    },
    "Determine the ordering or relationship": {
        "Use the relationships to determine the correct ordering or relationship between the objects": {}
    },
    "Draw a conclusion": {
        "Use the analysis to determine the correct answer": {}
    }
}
```

Here is an example of how this operationalized reasoning plan can be applied to one of the task examples:

```
{
    "Identify the objects and their relationships": {
        "Determine the three objects being compared": "station wagon, truck, motorcycle",
        "Identify the relationships between the objects": "newer/older"
    },
    "Analyze the individual statements": {
        "Statement 1: The truck is newer than the station wagon": {},
        "Statement 2: The motorcycle is the oldest": {}
    },
    "Determine the ordering or relationship": {
        "Use the relationships to determine the correct ordering or relationship between the objects": "motorcycle (oldest), station wagon, truck (newest)"
    },
    "Draw a conclusion": {
        "Use the analysis to determine the correct answer": "C) The motorcycle is the oldest"
    }
}
```
