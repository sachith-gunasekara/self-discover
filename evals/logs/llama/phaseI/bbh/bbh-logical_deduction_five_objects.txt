Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    "Step 1: Critical Thinking - Analyze the given information": {
        "Identify the objects and their relationships": {},
        "Determine the type of relationship (e.g. newer/older, more/less expensive, left/right)": {}
    },
    "Step 2: Simplification - Eliminate irrelevant information": {
        "Remove any statements that do not provide useful information": {}
    },
    "Step 3: Problem Decomposition - Break down the problem into smaller parts": {
        "Identify the individual relationships between objects": {}
    },
    "Step 4: Core Issue Identification - Determine the central question or problem": {
        "Identify the question being asked (e.g. which object is the second-newest, second-cheapest, etc.)": {}
    },
    "Step 5: Step-by-Step Analysis - Analyze the problem step by step": {
        "Use the relationships identified in Step 3 to determine the order or ranking of the objects": {}
    },
    "Step 6: Causal Analysis - Identify the underlying causes or factors": {
        "Determine how the relationships between objects affect the overall order or ranking": {}
    },
    "Step 7: Step-by-Step Planning - Develop a step-by-step plan to solve the problem": {
        "Use the information gathered in Steps 1-6 to determine the correct answer": {}
    },
    "Step 8: Creative Problem-Solving - Think creatively to identify novel solutions or approaches": {
        "Consider alternative approaches or perspectives to ensure the correct answer is found": {}
    }
}
```

This reasoning structure can be applied to tasks like those provided above to arrive at the correct answers.
