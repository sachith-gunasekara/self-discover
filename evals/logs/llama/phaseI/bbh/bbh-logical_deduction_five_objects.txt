Here is a more detailed version of the operationalized reasoning plan:

```
{
    Step 1: Identify the core ranking or ordering issue: {
        Identify the objects being ranked:,
        Identify the given constraints:,
        Determine the type of ranking (e.g., most expensive, newest, etc.):,
    },
    Step 2: Simplify the ranking problem: {
        Focus on the most relevant information:,
        Eliminate unnecessary details:,
        Identify any absolute positions (e.g., "the most expensive"):,
    },
    Step 3: Break down the ranking: {
        Analyze the relationships between individual objects:,
        Identify specific patterns (e.g., "A is more expensive than B"):,
        Determine the relative positions of each object:,
    },
    Step 4: Analyze the ranking problem from different perspectives: {
        Question assumptions about the order:,
        Evaluate the evidence or information available:,
        Consider alternative explanations:,
    },
    Step 5: Determine the underlying relationships or constraints: {
        Identify how they impact the overall order:,
        Determine the logical implications of each constraint:,
    },
    Step 6: Develop a step-by-step plan: {
        Analyze each piece of information:,
        Build on previous conclusions to determine the correct ranking:,
        Use logical analysis and deduction:,
    },
    Step 7: Implement the plan: {
        Apply the logical analysis and deduction:,
        Arrive at the correct answer:,
    },
    Step 8: Evaluate the answer options: {
        Compare the determined ranking with the given options:,
        Select the correct answer:,
    },
}
