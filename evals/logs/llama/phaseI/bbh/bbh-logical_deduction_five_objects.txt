Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    "Step 1: Identify the Core Issue": {
        "Identify the key question or problem that needs to be solved": 
    },
    "Step 2: Simplify the Problem": {
        "Eliminate unnecessary details and identify the most relevant information": 
    },
    "Step 3: Break Down the Problem": {
        "Divide the problem into smaller parts, such as individual statements or relationships": 
    },
    "Step 4: Identify Underlying Causes": {
        "Recognize the underlying relationships or rules that govern the order of objects": 
    },
    "Step 5: Analyze Relationships": {
        "Use Critical Thinking to analyze the relationships between objects and identify potential contradictions": 
    },
    "Step 6: Determine the Order": {
        "Use Systems Thinking to consider the objects as part of a larger system and determine the correct order": 
    },
    "Step 7: Evaluate Options": {
        "Use Technical or Practical Expertise to evaluate the options and select the correct answer": 
    },
    "Step 8: Verify the Solution": {
        "Use Step-by-Step Thinking to verify the solution and ensure it is logical and consistent": 
    }
}
```

Alternatively, a more detailed structure can be used:

```
{
    "Step 1: Identify the Core Issue": {
        "Identify the key question or problem that needs to be solved": 
    },
    "Step 2: Simplify the Problem": {
        "Eliminate unnecessary details": ,
        "Identify the most relevant information": 
    },
    "Step 3: Break Down the Problem": {
        "Divide the problem into smaller parts": ,
        "Identify individual statements or relationships": 
    },
    "Step 4: Identify Underlying Causes": {
        "Recognize underlying relationships or rules": ,
        "Identify the type of relationship (e.g. spatial, temporal, causal)": 
    },
    "Step 5: Analyze Relationships": {
        "Use Critical Thinking to analyze relationships": ,
        "Identify potential contradictions": ,
        "Evaluate the logical consistency of the information": 
    },
    "Step 6: Determine the Order": {
        "Use Systems Thinking to consider the objects as part of a larger system": ,
        "Identify patterns or relationships that can help determine the correct order": 
    },
    "Step 7: Evaluate Options": {
        "Use Technical or Practical Expertise to evaluate the options": ,
        "Select the correct answer based on the analysis": 
    },
    "Step 8: Verify the Solution": {
        "Use Step-by-Step Thinking to verify the solution": ,
        "Ensure the solution is logical and consistent": 
    }
}
