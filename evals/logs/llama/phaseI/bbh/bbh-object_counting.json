What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed?\n4. How can I simplify the problem so that it is easier to solve?\n9. How can I break down this problem into smaller, more manageable parts?\n16. What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed?\n25. Is the problem a technical or practical one that requires a specific expertise or skill set? Or is it more of a conceptual or theoretical problem?\n38. Let's think step by step.\n39. Let's make a step by step plan and implement it with good notion and explanation.\n\nAdditionally, the following modules can also be helpful:\n\n10. Critical Thinking: This style involves analyzing the problem from different perspectives, questioning assumptions, and evaluating the evidence or information available.\n13. Use systems thinking: Consider the problem as part of a larger system and understanding the interconnectedness of various elements.\n15. Use Reflective Thinking: Step back from the problem, take the time for introspection and self-reflection.",
    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. What are the key elements or items that need to be identified and counted in the problem?\n\n4. How can I categorize the items in the problem to simplify the counting process?\n\n9. How can I break down the list of items into smaller groups or categories to make it easier to count?\n\n16. What is the specific question being asked, and what type of items need to be counted?\n\n25. Is the problem a straightforward counting task, or are there any complexities or nuances that need to be considered?\n\n38. Let's go through the list of items step by step and identify which ones fit into the specified category.\n\n39. Let's make a plan to systematically count the items in the list, and then implement it to ensure accuracy.\n\nAdditionally, the following modules can also be helpful:\n\n10. Critical Thinking: Analyze the list of items from different perspectives to ensure that all relevant items are being counted, and question any assumptions about the categories or groups.\n\n13. Use systems thinking: Consider the relationships between the different items in the list, and how they might be grouped or categorized in different ways.\n\n15. Use Reflective Thinking: Take a step back and review the list of items to ensure that all relevant items have been counted, and that the counting process has been accurate.",
