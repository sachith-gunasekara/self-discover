    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. Critical Thinking: Analyze statements from different perspectives, identify potential contradictions, and evaluate the truthfulness of each statement based on the information provided.\n\n4. Simplification: Identify the key statements and relationships between them to isolate the core issue and eliminate irrelevant information.\n\n9. Problem Decomposition: Break down the problem into smaller parts by analyzing each statement separately, identifying the speaker and the person being referred to, and determining the truthfulness of each statement.\n\n16. Core Issue Identification: Determine the central question or issue that needs to be addressed, such as \"Does person X tell the truth?\" and focus on resolving that issue.\n\n17. Causal Analysis: Identify the chain of statements and relationships between them to understand how each statement affects the truthfulness of others.\n\n38. Step-by-Step Analysis: Analyze each statement in sequence, using the information provided to determine the truthfulness of each subsequent statement.\n\n39. Step-by-Step Planning: Create a plan to systematically evaluate each statement, using a logical and methodical approach to determine the truthfulness of the final statement.",

It involves analyzing each statement in sequence, updating the list of truthfulness of each person, and then evaluating the truthfulness of each person based on the information provided. Finally, it determines the truthfulness of the target person by looking up their truthfulness in the list.",
