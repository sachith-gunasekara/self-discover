    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. Critical Thinking: Analyze statements from different individuals, identify potential contradictions, and evaluate the truthfulness of each statement based on the information provided.\n\n4. Simplification: Identify the key statements and individuals involved in the problem, and focus on the most relevant information to determine the truthfulness of the target individual.\n\n9. Problem Decomposition: Break down the problem into smaller parts by analyzing each statement separately, identifying the relationships between individuals, and determining the implications of each statement on the overall problem.\n\n16. Core Issue Identification: Determine the central question or issue that needs to be addressed, such as whether a specific individual tells the truth or lies.\n\n17. Causal Analysis: Identify the chain of statements and relationships between individuals that contribute to the problem, and analyze how each statement affects the truthfulness of the target individual.\n\n38. Step-by-Step Analysis: Analyze each statement in sequence, considering the implications of each statement on the next, to determine the truthfulness of the target individual.\n\n39. Step-by-Step Planning: Develop a systematic plan to analyze each statement, identify potential contradictions, and evaluate the truthfulness of each individual, leading to a conclusion about the target individual.",
