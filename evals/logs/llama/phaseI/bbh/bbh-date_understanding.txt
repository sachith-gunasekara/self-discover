Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    Determine the current date: {
        Identify the given date information:,
        Determine the format of the given date (MM/DD/YYYY or Month/Day/Year):,
        Convert the date to MM/DD/YYYY format if necessary:,
    },
    Determine the date calculation needed: {
        Identify the date-related issue or problem (e.g. find a date in the past or future):,
        Determine the time period for the calculation (e.g. one week, one year):,
    },
    Simplify the date calculation: {
        Identify relevant information (e.g. current date, time period):,
        Eliminate irrelevant details:,
    },
    Break down the date problem into smaller parts: {
        Calculate the day, month, and year separately if necessary:,
    },
    Perform the date calculation: {
        Add or subtract the time period from the current date:,
        Consider leap years and date formatting if necessary:,
    },
    Determine the resulting date: {
        Combine the calculated day, month, and year:,
        Ensure the date is in MM/DD/YYYY format:,
    },
}
```

This reasoning plan can be applied to tasks like those provided above to arrive at the correct answers.
