Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    Identify the initial date and any given time passed: {
        Extract the initial date from the problem statement,
        Extract any given time passed from the problem statement
    },
    Determine the required date format: {
        Identify the required date format (e.g. MM/DD/YYYY)
    },
    Calculate the number of days in each month: {
        Consider the number of days in each month (e.g. 31, 30, 28, 29),
        Account for leap years
    },
    Calculate the day of the week: {
        Determine the day of the week for the initial date
    },
    Calculate the new date: {
        Add or subtract the given time passed from the initial date,
        Consider the month and year when calculating the new date
    },
    Adjust for 24 hours later or earlier: {
        Add or subtract 1 day from the new date if necessary
    },
    Format the answer: {
        Format the new date in the required date format (e.g. MM/DD/YYYY)
    }
}
