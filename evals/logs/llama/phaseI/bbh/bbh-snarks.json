What are the underlying tone, language, and intent assumptions in the given statements that could indicate sarcasm?\n\n4.

    "reasoning_structure": "Here's a step-by-step reasoning plan in JSON format for identifying sarcasm in statements:\n\n```\n{\n    Analyze the tone and language of the statements: {\n        Identify words or phrases with strong emotional connotations:,\n        Check for irony, understatement, or exaggeration:,\n        Look for inconsistencies between what is said and what is meant:,\n    },\n    Simplify the language and context of the statements: {\n        Remove any unnecessary words or phrases:,\n        Identify the main point or message of the statement:,\n        Consider the context in which the statement is made:,\n    },\n    Consider alternative interpretations or perspectives: {\n        Think about the opposite of what is explicitly stated:,\n        Look for subtle cues or implications:,\n        Consider the statement from different viewpoints:,\n    },\n    Evaluate the intent behind the words: {\n        Question the purpose of the statement:,\n        Consider the tone and language used:,\n        Look for evidence of sarcasm, such as irony or understatement:,\n    },\n    Compare the statements to identify the sarcastic one: {\n        Look for differences in tone, language, and intent:,\n        Consider the context and main point of each statement:,\n        Choose the statement that is most likely to be sarcastic:,\n    },\n}\n```\n\nThis reasoning plan can be applied to tasks like the ones provided above to identify the sarcastic statement.",
