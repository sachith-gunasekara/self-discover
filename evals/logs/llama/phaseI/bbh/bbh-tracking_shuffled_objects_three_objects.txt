Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    Identify the initial state of the elements being exchanged or swapped: {
        Note the starting positions or possessions of each individual:,
    },
    Break down the problem into smaller parts by focusing on each swap or exchange individually: {
        Analyze the state of the elements after each swap:,
    },
    Determine the order of swaps and the individuals involved in each swap: {
        List the sequence of swaps and the parties involved in each:,
    },
    Track the changes that occur during each swap: {
        Use a systematic approach, such as diagrams or charts, to visualize the process:,
    },
    Analyze the final state of the elements after all swaps have occurred: {
        Determine the final positions or possessions of each individual:,
    },
    Identify the correct answer based on the final state of the elements: {
        Select the option that matches the final position or possession of the relevant individual:,
    },
}
```

This reasoning plan can be applied to tasks like those provided, where a series of swaps or exchanges occur, and the goal is to determine the final state of the elements being exchanged.
