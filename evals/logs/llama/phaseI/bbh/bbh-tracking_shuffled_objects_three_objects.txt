Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    Identify the initial positions or possessions of the entities: {
        Record the starting positions or possessions of each entity (e.g., Alice, Bob, Claire),
    },
    Break down the sequence of swaps or trades: {
        List the swaps or trades in the order they occur,
    },
    Create a notation system to track the updates: {
        Assign a variable or symbol to each entity's position or possession,
    },
    Apply the swaps or trades step by step: {
        Update the notation system after each swap or trade,
    },
    Determine the final position or possession of the target entity: {
        Use the updated notation system to find the final position or possession of the target entity (e.g., Claire's position, Bob's book),
    },
    Match the final position or possession to the answer options: {
        Compare the final position or possession to the answer options and select the correct one,
    },
}
