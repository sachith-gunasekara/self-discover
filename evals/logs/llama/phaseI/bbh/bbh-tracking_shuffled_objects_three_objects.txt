Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    Identify the initial items held by each person: {
        Record the item each person starts with:,
    },
    Identify the sequence of trades: {
        Record the order in which the trades are made and the people involved in each trade:,
    },
    Analyze the sequence of trades step by step: {
        For each trade, update the items held by the people involved:,
    },
    Determine the final item held by the person of interest: {
        After analyzing all trades, identify the item held by the person specified in the question:,
    },
}
```

Alternatively, a more detailed plan:

```
{
    Initialize the tracking system: {
        Create a table or list to track the items held by each person:,
        Record the initial items held by each person in the table:,
    },
    Analyze the first trade: {
        Identify the people involved in the trade:,
        Update the items held by the people involved in the trade:,
    },
    Analyze subsequent trades: {
        For each trade, repeat the steps from the first trade:,
    },
    Determine the final item held by the person of interest: {
        After analyzing all trades, look up the item held by the person specified in the question in the tracking table:,
    },
}
```

Or, an even more systematic approach:

```
{
    Define the initial state: {
        Record the initial items held by each person:,
    },
    Iterate through the trades: {
        For each trade, apply the following steps:,
        Identify the people involved in the trade:,
        Swap the items held by the people involved in the trade:,
        Update the tracking system to reflect the new items held by each person:,
    },
    Determine the final item held by the person of interest: {
        After iterating through all trades, identify the item held by the person specified in the question:,
    },
}
```
