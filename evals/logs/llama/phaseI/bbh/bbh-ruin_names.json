    "selected_modules": "Based on the task examples, the following reasoning modules are crucial for solving tasks like them:\n\n1. Try creative thinking, generate innovative and out-of-the-box ideas to solve the problem. Explore unconventional solutions, thinking beyond traditional boundaries, and encouraging imagination and originality. (11)\n2. What are the key assumptions underlying this problem? (5)\n3. What are the alternative perspectives or viewpoints on this problem? (7)\n4. Critical Thinking: This style involves analyzing the problem from different perspectives, questioning assumptions, and evaluating the evidence or information available. (10)\n5. Use Reflective Thinking: Step back from the problem, take the time for introspection and self-reflection. Examine personal biases, assumptions, and mental models that may influence problem-solving, and being open to learning from past experiences to improve future approaches. (15)\n6. What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed? (16)\n7. Are there any potential solutions or strategies that have been tried before? If yes, what were the outcomes and lessons learned? (18)\n8. Let's imagine the current best solution is totally wrong, what other ways are there to think about the problem specification? (35)\n9. Ignoring the current best solution, create an entirely new solution to the problem. (37)",
    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. Think creatively about wordplay, generate humorous and whimsical edits to the original text by manipulating words, sounds, and meanings. Explore unconventional uses of language, encouraging imagination and originality.\n\n2. What are the key linguistic or cultural assumptions underlying the original text that could be exploited for humorous effect?\n\n3. What are the alternative perspectives or viewpoints on the original text that could be used to create a humorous edit, such as a play on words or a clever twist on the original meaning?\n\n4. Critical Thinking: Analyze the original text from different linguistic and cultural perspectives, questioning assumptions about the meaning and context of the words, and evaluating the potential for humorous edits.\n\n5. Use Reflective Thinking: Step back from the original text, take the time for introspection and self-reflection on your own linguistic and cultural biases, and consider how these biases might influence your approach to creating a humorous edit.\n\n6. What is the core element of the original text that could be targeted for humorous effect, such as a word, phrase, or concept that could be cleverly manipulated or subverted?\n\n7. Are there any common techniques or strategies for creating humorous edits, such as puns, double meanings, or clever turns of phrase, that have been used effectively in similar contexts?\n\n8. Let's imagine that the most obvious approach to creating a humorous edit is totally wrong, what other ways are there to think about manipulating the original text for comedic effect?\n\n9. Ignoring the most obvious approaches, create an entirely new and original humorous edit of the original text, using wordplay, clever twists, or other creative techniques.",
