    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. Creative Thinking: Generate humorous and playful ideas by manipulating words, phrases, or characters in the original title, exploring possibilities like word substitutions, letter swaps, or clever twists on the original name.\n\n2. Alternative Perspectives: Consider different viewpoints on what makes a humorous edit, such as playing with homophones, using wordplay, or referencing pop culture, to identify the most amusing option.\n\n3. Critical Thinking: Analyze each option by evaluating the use of language, syntax, and semantics, and questioning assumptions about what makes a humorous edit, to identify potential biases or flaws in thinking.\n\n4. Step-by-Step Thinking: Break down the original title into its components, such as words, phrases, or characters, and systematically evaluate each option by comparing it to the original, identifying any changes or manipulations that create humor.\n\n5. Typical Solutions: Identify common patterns or techniques used in humorous edits, such as replacing a word with a similar-sounding one, adding or removing a letter, or using a clever pun, to inform the evaluation of options.\n\n6. Possible Solutions: Given the original title and the options provided, make educated guesses about other possible humorous edits, considering factors like wordplay, satire, or absurdity, to help identify the most likely humorous edit.",
