Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    "Identify the items to be counted": {
        "List all the individual items mentioned in the problem": {}
    },
    "Categorize the items": {
        "Determine the common characteristic or category of the items to be counted": {}
    },
    "Group similar items together": {
        "Group the items into distinct categories based on their common characteristics": {}
    },
    "Count each group": {
        "Count the number of items in each group": {}
    },
    "Add up the totals": {
        "Add up the counts from each group to find the total number of items": {}
    },
    "Answer the question": {
        "Use the total count to answer the specific question being asked": {}
    }
}
```

This reasoning plan can be applied to all the task examples provided, and it should lead to the correct answers. The plan involves identifying the items to be counted, categorizing them, grouping similar items together, counting each group, adding up the totals, and finally answering the question.
