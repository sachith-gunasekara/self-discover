Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    Identify the key elements or items that need to be identified and counted in the problem: {
        Read the problem statement and identify the items listed:,
    },
    Determine the specific question being asked, and what type of items need to be counted: {
        Identify the question being asked and the type of items to be counted (e.g. animals, fruits, objects, etc.):,
    },
    Categorize the items in the problem to simplify the counting process: {
        Group the items into categories based on the type of items to be counted:,
    },
    Break down the list of items into smaller groups or categories to make it easier to count: {
        Use the categories to group similar items together:,
    },
    Systematically count the items in the list: {
        Go through the list of items step by step and count the items that fit into the specified category:,
    },
    Review the list of items to ensure accuracy: {
        Take a step back and review the list of items to ensure that all relevant items have been counted:,
    },
    Provide the final answer: {
        Report the total count of items:,
    },
}
