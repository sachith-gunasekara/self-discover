    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. What are the specific time slots mentioned in the problem, and how can they be used to determine the possible time range for the activity in question?\n\n4. How can I eliminate impossible time slots based on the given information to narrow down the possible time range for the activity?\n\n9. What are the gaps in time between the mentioned activities, and could the activity in question have taken place during one of these gaps?\n\n16. What is the earliest and latest possible time for the activity in question, based on the given information?\n\n17. Are there any time slots that are already occupied by other activities, and how can this information be used to determine the possible time range for the activity in question?\n\n20. What specific times are mentioned in the problem, and how can they be used as boundaries to determine the possible time range for the activity?\n\n25. Is the problem a matter of finding a time slot that fits within a given schedule, and if so, how can I use the given information to determine the possible time range?\n\n38. Let's go through the timeline step by step and identify any gaps or openings where the activity in question could have taken place.\n\n39. Let's create a step-by-step timeline of the given activities and use it to identify the most likely time range for the activity in question.",
