Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    Initialize an empty list to store the statements: {},
    Initialize an empty list to store the truthfulness of each person: {},
    Step 1: Analyze each statement in sequence {
        Identify the speaker and the person being referred to: {},
        Determine the truthfulness of the statement based on the information provided: {},
        Update the list of truthfulness of each person: {},
    },
    Step 2: Evaluate the truthfulness of each person {
        If a person is said to tell the truth by someone who tells the truth, mark them as truthful: {},
        If a person is said to lie by someone who tells the truth, mark them as untruthful: {},
        If a person is said to tell the truth by someone who lies, mark them as untruthful: {},
        If a person is said to lie by someone who lies, mark them as truthful: {},
    },
    Step 3: Determine the truthfulness of the target person {
        Look up the truthfulness of the target person in the list: {},
        Return the truthfulness of the target person: {},
    },
}
```

This reasoning plan can be applied to all the task examples provided. It involves analyzing each statement in sequence, updating the list of truthfulness of each person, and then evaluating the truthfulness of each person based on the information provided. Finally, it determines the truthfulness of the target person by looking up their truthfulness in the list.
