Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    "Step 1: Identify the statements and their relationships": {
        "List all the statements and their corresponding speakers and subjects": [],
        "Create a table or graph to visualize the relationships between the statements": []
    },
    "Step 2: Simplify the problem and identify the core issue": {
        "Eliminate any irrelevant information and isolate the key statements and relationships": [],
        "Determine the central question or issue that needs to be addressed": []
    },
    "Step 3: Analyze each statement separately": {
        "Break down the problem into smaller parts by analyzing each statement": [],
        "Identify the speaker and the subject of each statement": [],
        "Determine the truthfulness of each statement based on the information provided": []
    },
    "Step 4: Identify potential contradictions and evaluate the truthfulness of each statement": {
        "Compare the statements and identify any potential contradictions": [],
        "Evaluate the truthfulness of each statement based on the information provided and the relationships between the statements": []
    },
    "Step 5: Determine the truthfulness of each individual": {
        "Use the information gathered in the previous steps to determine the truthfulness of each individual": [],
        "Consider the relationships between the statements and the potential contradictions": []
    },
    "Step 6: Answer the central question or issue": {
        "Use the information gathered in the previous steps to answer the central question or issue": [],
        "Provide a clear and logical explanation for the answer": []
    }
}
```

This operationalized reasoning plan provides a step-by-step structure for solvers to follow and arrive at correct answers for tasks like those provided. It includes steps for identifying the statements and their relationships, simplifying the problem, analyzing each statement separately, identifying potential contradictions, determining the truthfulness of each individual, and answering the central question or issue.
