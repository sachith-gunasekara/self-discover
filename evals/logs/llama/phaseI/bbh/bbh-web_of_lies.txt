Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    "Step 1: Identify the target individual": {
        "Identify the individual whose truthfulness needs to be determined": {}
    },
    "Step 2: Analyze statements from different individuals": {
        "Create a list of statements and their corresponding individuals": {}
    },
    "Step 3: Identify potential contradictions": {
        "Compare statements to identify any contradictions or inconsistencies": {}
    },
    "Step 4: Evaluate the truthfulness of each statement": {
        "Use the information provided to determine the truthfulness of each statement": {}
    },
    "Step 5: Determine the relationships between individuals": {
        "Analyze the statements to identify the relationships between individuals": {}
    },
    "Step 6: Identify the chain of statements and relationships": {
        "Determine the sequence of statements and relationships that contribute to the problem": {}
    },
    "Step 7: Analyze the implications of each statement": {
        "Consider the implications of each statement on the next statement in the sequence": {}
    },
    "Step 8: Determine the truthfulness of the target individual": {
        "Use the analysis from the previous steps to determine the truthfulness of the target individual": {}
    }
}
```

Alternatively, the reasoning plan can be represented in a more detailed and structured way as follows:

```
{
    "Critical Thinking": {
        "Analyze statements from different individuals": {
            "Create a list of statements and their corresponding individuals": {}
        },
        "Identify potential contradictions": {
            "Compare statements to identify any contradictions or inconsistencies": {}
        }
    },
    "Simplification": {
        "Identify the key statements and individuals involved in the problem": {
            "Focus on the most relevant information to determine the truthfulness of the target individual": {}
        }
    },
    "Problem Decomposition": {
        "Break down the problem into smaller parts": {
            "Analyze each statement separately": {},
            "Identify the relationships between individuals": {}
        }
    },
    "Core Issue Identification": {
        "Determine the central question or issue that needs to be addressed": {
            "Identify the target individual whose truthfulness needs to be determined": {}
        }
    },
    "Causal Analysis": {
        "Identify the chain of statements and relationships between individuals": {
            "Analyze how each statement affects the truthfulness of the target individual": {}
        }
    },
    "Step-by-Step Analysis": {
        "Analyze each statement in sequence": {
            "Consider the implications of each statement on the next statement in the sequence": {}
        }
    },
    "Step-by-Step Planning": {
        "Develop a systematic plan to analyze each statement": {
            "Identify potential contradictions": {},
            "Evaluate the truthfulness of each individual": {}
        }
    }
}
