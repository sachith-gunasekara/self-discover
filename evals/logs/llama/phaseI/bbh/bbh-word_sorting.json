What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed?\n4. How can I simplify the problem so that it is easier to solve?\n9. How can I break down this problem into smaller, more manageable parts?\n38. Let's think step by step.\n39. Let's make a step by step plan and implement it with good notion and explanation.\n\nThese modules can help in solving tasks that involve sorting words alphabetically by breaking down the problem into smaller parts, simplifying the task, and implementing a step-by-step plan.",
    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. What are the key elements that need to be organized or sorted in this problem, and what is the primary goal or objective?\n\n4. How can I simplify the task of sorting these words by identifying common characteristics, such as alphabetical order, and eliminating any unnecessary information?\n\n9. How can I break down this list of words into smaller, more manageable groups, such as by starting letter or prefix, to make it easier to sort them alphabetically?\n\n38. Let's think step by step: what is the first step in sorting these words, and what subsequent steps will I need to take to ensure they are in alphabetical order?\n\n39. Let's make a step-by-step plan to sort these words alphabetically, including identifying the starting letter of each word, comparing words with the same starting letter, and double-checking the sorted list for accuracy.",
