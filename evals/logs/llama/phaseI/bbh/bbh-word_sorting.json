How can I break down this problem into smaller, more manageable parts?\n38. Let's think step by step.\n39. Let's make a step by step plan and implement it with good notion and explanation.\n\nThese modules can help in solving tasks that involve sorting and organizing data, such as alphabetizing lists of words.",
    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. How can I simplify the problem of sorting and organizing data by identifying the key elements that need to be arranged in a specific order, such as alphabetizing a list of words?\n\n4. How can I break down the list of words into smaller, more manageable parts, such as grouping words that start with the same letter or sound, to make it easier to sort and organize them alphabetically?\n\n38. Let's think step by step about the process of sorting the list of words, starting with the first word and comparing it to the next word, and then the next, to ensure that each word is in its correct alphabetical order.\n\n39. Let's make a step-by-step plan to sort the list of words alphabetically, including steps such as: \n- Write down the list of words\n- Identify the first word and its starting letter\n- Compare the first word to the next word and determine which one comes first alphabetically\n- Continue comparing and rearranging the words until the entire list is in alphabetical order\n- Double-check the list to ensure that it is accurate and complete.",
