Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
  "Step 1: Identify the objects and their relationships": {
    "List all the objects mentioned in the problem": [],
    "Identify the relationships between the objects (e.g. older than, newer than, to the left of, etc.)": []
  },
  "Step 2: Simplify the problem and eliminate irrelevant information": {
    "Remove any unnecessary words or phrases from the problem statement": [],
    "Focus on the key relationships between the objects": []
  },
  "Step 3: Decompose the problem into smaller parts": {
    "Break down the problem into individual statements or relationships": [],
    "Analyze each statement or relationship separately": []
  },
  "Step 4: Identify the core issue or question": {
    "Determine what is being asked in the problem (e.g. what is the order of the objects?)": [],
    "Focus on resolving the core issue or question": []
  },
  "Step 5: Analyze the causal structure of the problem": {
    "Identify the underlying relationships and constraints between the objects": [],
    "Determine how the relationships and constraints affect the order or position of the objects": []
  },
  "Step 6: Create a plan to tackle the problem": {
    "Break down the problem into manageable steps": [],
    "Determine the most effective order in which to analyze the relationships and constraints": []
  },
  "Step 7: Execute the plan and arrive at a solution": {
    "Analyze each relationship and constraint in the determined order": [],
    "Use logical deductions and inferences to build up a solution": []
  },
  "Step 8: Verify the solution": {
    "Check the solution against the original problem statement": [],
    "Ensure that the solution satisfies all the relationships and constraints": []
  }
}
```

This reasoning structure can be applied to all the task examples provided, and can help solvers arrive at the correct answers.
