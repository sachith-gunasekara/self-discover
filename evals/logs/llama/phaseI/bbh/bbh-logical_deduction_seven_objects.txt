Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
  "Step 1: Identify the core issue or problem": {
    "Identify the type of problem": "sequencing or ordering",
    "Determine the number of objects": "seven"
  },
  "Step 2: Simplify the problem": {
    "Identify the most relevant information": "statements about the relationships between objects",
    "Eliminate unnecessary details": "ignore irrelevant information"
  },
  "Step 3: Break down the problem": {
    "Analyze the relationships between individual objects": "identify specific positions in the sequence",
    "Identify constraints on the sequence": "determine the order of objects based on the relationships"
  },
  "Step 4: Analyze the problem from different perspectives": {
    "Question assumptions": "verify the relationships between objects",
    "Evaluate the evidence or information available": "check for consistency in the statements"
  },
  "Step 5: Create a step-by-step plan": {
    "Implement a clear and logical approach": "use the relationships and constraints to determine the order",
    "Use a systematic method": "start with the most constrained object and work from there"
  },
  "Step 6: Determine the correct order or sequence": {
    "Use the plan to determine the order": "apply the relationships and constraints to each object",
    "Verify the answer": "check that the order is consistent with all the statements"
  }
}
```

This reasoning structure can be applied to tasks like those above to arrive at the correct answers.
