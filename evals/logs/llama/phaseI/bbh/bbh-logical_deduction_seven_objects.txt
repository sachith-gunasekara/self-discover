Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    Identify the primary objective: {
        Determine the question being asked and the information provided,
    },
    Simplify the given information: {
        Identify the most relevant statements, objects, or relationships that will help solve the problem,
    },
    Break down the problem: {
        Identify the relationships between individual objects, or group objects based on their characteristics or positions,
    },
    Analyze the problem from different perspectives: {
        Consider the objects' positions, relationships, or characteristics, and evaluate the evidence or information provided to identify patterns, inconsistencies, or logical connections,
    },
    Determine the key issue or problem: {
        Identify the essential elements or relationships that need to be understood to solve the problem,
    },
    Identify underlying relationships, patterns, or rules: {
        Use the information to make inferences or deductions,
    },
    Look for relevant data, patterns, or relationships: {
        Identify any symmetries, asymmetries, or correlations between objects,
    },
    Determine the problem type: {
        Identify if the problem is a logical or spatial reasoning puzzle that requires a specific skill set or expertise,
    },
    Create a step-by-step plan: {
        Identify the key elements, relationships, and patterns, and implement a logical and systematic approach to solve the problem,
    },
    Execute the plan: {
        Analyze each statement or piece of information individually, and build a logical chain of reasoning to arrive at a solution,
    },
    Draw a conclusion: {
        Use the logical chain of reasoning to select the correct answer,
    },
}
```

Here is a more detailed and specific operationalized reasoning plan for the given task examples:

```
{
    Read and understand the problem: {
        Identify the objects and their relationships,
    },
    Create a list of objects: {
        List all the objects mentioned in the problem,
    },
    Identify the given relationships: {
        List all the relationships mentioned in the problem,
    },
    Determine the type of relationship: {
        Identify if the relationship is based on position, age, or other characteristics,
    },
    Create a diagram or table: {
        Visualize the relationships between the objects,
    },
    Analyze the diagram or table: {
        Look for patterns, inconsistencies, or logical connections,
    },
    Make inferences or deductions: {
        Use the information to make conclusions about the objects and their relationships,
    },
    Identify the question being asked: {
        Determine what is being asked about the objects and their relationships,
    },
    Use the inferences or deductions: {
        Answer the question based on the conclusions made,
    },
    Select the correct answer: {
        Choose the answer that matches the conclusion,
    },
}
