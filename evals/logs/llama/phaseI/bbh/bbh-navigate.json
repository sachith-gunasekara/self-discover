    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. Let's analyze the instructions step by step to understand the movements and their impact on the starting position.\n\n2. Develop a systematic plan to track the movements, considering the direction and number of steps, and evaluate their cumulative effect on the starting point.\n\n3. Identify the key issue that determines whether the instructions lead back to the starting point, such as the net displacement or the cancellation of movements.\n\n4. Break down the instructions into smaller segments, analyzing the effect of each segment on the position and how they interact with each other.\n\n5. Examine the instructions from different perspectives, considering the direction, distance, and any turns or changes in orientation, and assess the evidence for returning to the starting point.\n\n9. Divide the instructions into manageable parts, analyzing the movement patterns, such as forward and backward or left and right, to determine their overall impact on the starting position.\n\n38. Analyze the sequence of movements step by step, considering how each step affects the position and whether the instructions ultimately lead back to the starting point.\n\n39. Create a step-by-step plan to track the movements, considering any changes in direction or orientation, and evaluate the cumulative effect on the starting position to determine if it returns to the starting point.",
