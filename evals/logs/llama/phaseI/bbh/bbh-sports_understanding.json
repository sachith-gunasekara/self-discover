Critical Thinking: This style involves analyzing the problem from different perspectives, questioning assumptions, and evaluating the evidence or information available.\n16. What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed?\n25. Is the problem a technical or practical one that requires a specific expertise or skill set? Or is it more of a conceptual or theoretical problem?\n30. Is the problem a design challenge that requires creative solutions and innovation?\n34. Given the problem specification and the current best solution, have a guess about other possible solutions.\n35. Let's imagine the current best solution is totally wrong, what other ways are there to think about the problem specification?",
    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. What specific knowledge or context is required to understand the key elements of this sentence, and are they being used correctly?\n\n4. How can I break down the sentence into its individual components (e.g. person, action, event, location) to better assess its plausibility?\n\n10. Critical Thinking: Analyze the sentence from different perspectives, considering the sport, player, and action involved, and evaluate the evidence or information available to determine its plausibility.\n\n16. What is the central claim or action being described in the sentence that needs to be verified or assessed?\n\n25. Is the sentence describing a technical or practical aspect of a sport that requires specific expertise or knowledge, or is it more general in nature?\n\n30. Does the sentence require creative or innovative thinking to understand the context or action being described, or is it a straightforward claim?\n\n34. Given the information provided in the sentence, what alternative explanations or interpretations could be possible?\n\n35. Let's assume the sentence is incorrect or misleading - what other ways could the information be interpreted or what other explanations could be possible?",
