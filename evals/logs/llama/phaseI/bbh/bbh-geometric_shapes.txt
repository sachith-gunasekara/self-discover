Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    "Step 1: Analyze the SVG path element": {
        "Break down the SVG path element into its basic components, such as lines, curves, and angles": {},
        "Identify the key characteristics of the SVG path element, such as its number of sides, angles, and symmetries": {}
    },
    "Step 2: Identify the shape": {
        "Compare the key characteristics of the SVG path element to known geometric shapes": {},
        "Consider the SVG path element as part of a larger system of geometric shapes and understand how it relates to other shapes": {}
    },
    "Step 3: Determine the correct answer": {
        "Match the identified shape to the available options": {}
    }
}
```

However, a more detailed structure can be provided as follows:

```
{
    "Step 1: Break down the SVG path element into its basic components": {
        "Identify the individual lines, curves, and angles that make up the SVG path element": {},
        "Determine the relationships between these components, such as intersections and connections": {}
    },
    "Step 2: Identify the key characteristics of the SVG path element": {
        "Determine the number of sides of the shape": {},
        "Identify the angles and symmetries of the shape": {}
    },
    "Step 3: Compare the key characteristics to known geometric shapes": {
        "Match the number of sides, angles, and symmetries to known shapes, such as triangles, quadrilaterals, and polygons": {},
        "Consider the relationships between the components and how they relate to known shapes": {}
    },
    "Step 4: Consider the SVG path element as part of a larger system of geometric shapes": {
        "Understand how the shape relates to other shapes, such as similarities and differences": {},
        "Consider the shape in the context of the available options": {}
    },
    "Step 5: Determine the correct answer": {
        "Match the identified shape to the available options": {}
    }
}
