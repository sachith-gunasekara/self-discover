Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    "Step 1: Break down the SVG path element into individual lines or curves": {
        "Identify the 'M' and 'L' commands in the SVG path element": {},
        "Split the path into separate lines or curves based on the 'M' commands": {}
    },
    "Step 2: Identify the key points and lines that define the shape": {
        "Extract the coordinates of the key points from the 'M' and 'L' commands": {},
        "Determine the number of lines, curves, or angles in the shape": {}
    },
    "Step 3: Analyze the shape from different perspectives": {
        "Rotate or reflect the shape to identify symmetries or patterns": {},
        "Consider the shape as part of a larger geometric system": {}
    },
    "Step 4: Determine the geometric features of the shape": {
        "Count the number of sides, angles, or curves in the shape": {},
        "Identify any symmetries or patterns in the shape": {}
    },
    "Step 5: Match the shape to a known geometric shape": {
        "Compare the shape's features to a list of known geometric shapes": {},
        "Select the shape that best matches the features": {}
    }
}
```

This reasoning plan can be applied to any SVG path element to determine the geometric shape it creates.
