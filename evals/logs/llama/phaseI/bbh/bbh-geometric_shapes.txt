Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    "Analyze the SVG path element": {
        "Identify the type of path elements (e.g., lines, curves, arcs)": {},
        "Determine the number of path elements": {}
    },
    "Simplify the problem": {
        "Identify the key coordinates and lines that define the shape": {},
        "Focus on the essential features that distinguish it from other options": {}
    },
    "Break down the problem into smaller parts": {
        "Divide the SVG path element into individual line segments, curves, or shapes": {},
        "Analyze each component separately to understand its contribution to the overall shape": {}
    },
    "Apply geometric concepts and techniques": {
        "Consider the relationships between the coordinates, the shape's symmetry, and potential geometric patterns": {},
        "Apply knowledge of geometry and spatial reasoning to understand the shape": {}
    },
    "Evaluate the shape": {
        "Consider alternative shapes that could be formed by the SVG path element": {},
        "Evaluate their feasibility based on the given coordinates and geometric constraints": {}
    },
    "Determine the shape": {
        "Based on the analysis, simplification, and breakdown of the problem, determine the shape": {},
        "Select the correct answer from the options": {}
    }
}
```

This reasoning plan provides a step-by-step structure for solvers to follow and arrive at the correct answer. It involves analyzing the SVG path element, simplifying the problem, breaking it down into smaller parts, applying geometric concepts and techniques, evaluating the shape, and determining the final answer.
