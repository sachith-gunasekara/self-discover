Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    "Analyze the given movie titles": {
        "Identify common themes, genres, or elements": {},
    },
    "Identify underlying assumptions": {
        "Consider the era, director, awards won, and other relevant factors": {},
    },
    "Consider different viewpoints": {
        "Think about plot, tone, style, cast, and other possible similarities": {},
    },
    "Generate innovative ideas for movie similarities": {
        "Think about soundtracks, cinematography, cultural impact, and other creative connections": {},
    },
    "Reflect on commonalities among the listed movies": {
        "Look for patterns and relationships between the movies": {},
    },
    "Identify the central theme or element": {
        "Determine what ties the listed movies together": {},
    },
    "Analyze each option against the identified theme or element": {
        "Compare each option to the commonalities and patterns found in the listed movies": {},
    },
    "Select the option that best matches the identified theme or element": {
        "Choose the option that is most similar to the listed movies based on the analysis": {},
    },
}
```

This reasoning structure can be applied to all the task examples provided, and it should help solvers arrive at the correct answers.
