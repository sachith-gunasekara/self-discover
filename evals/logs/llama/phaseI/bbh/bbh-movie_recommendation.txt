Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
  "Step 1: Identify Key Themes and Genres": {
    "Analyze the given movies to identify common themes, genres, or elements": {},
    "Consider factors such as director, era, awards won, and cinematography": {}
  },
  "Step 2: Narrow Down Options": {
    "Focus on specific aspects of the movies to narrow down the options": {},
    "Use the identified themes and genres to eliminate irrelevant options": {}
  },
  "Step 3: Analyze from Different Perspectives": {
    "Analyze the given movies from different perspectives (e.g. plot, character development, tone)": {},
    "Evaluate the evidence to determine which option is most similar": {}
  },
  "Step 4: Identify Core Characteristics": {
    "Identify the core characteristic or essence that defines the given movies": {},
    "Use this characteristic to identify a similar movie among the options": {}
  },
  "Step 5: Consider Underlying Factors": {
    "Consider underlying factors such as historical context, social commentary, or special effects": {},
    "Use these factors to identify a match among the options": {}
  },
