Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    Identify the key detail or specific information that needs to be focused on in the problem: {
        Read the problem statement and identify the key elements such as objects, colors, and their positions in the arrangement:,
    },
    Eliminate irrelevant information and isolate the essential elements of the problem: {
        Filter out unnecessary information and focus on the key elements identified in the previous step:,
    },
    Break down the problem into smaller parts: {
        Identify the objects, their colors, and their positions in the arrangement:,
    },
    Identify the specific question being asked and the information needed to answer it: {
        Determine what information is required to answer the question, such as the color of an object or its position:,
    },
    Analyze the problem step by step: {
        Use the information gathered in the previous steps to analyze the problem and arrive at a solution:,
    },
    Create a mental or visual representation of the arrangement: {
        Use the information gathered to create a mental or visual representation of the arrangement and identify the key information needed to answer the question:,
    },
    Use the representation to answer the question: {
        Use the mental or visual representation to identify the answer to the question, such as the color of an object or its position:,
    },
}
```

Here is a more detailed and specific version of the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    Identify the key objects and their colors in the arrangement: {
        Read the problem statement and identify the objects and their corresponding colors:,
    },
    Identify the key positions in the arrangement: {
        Identify the positions of the objects in the arrangement, such as "to the left of" or "to the right of":,
    },
    Identify the specific object or position being asked about: {
        Determine which object or position is being asked about in the question:,
    },
    Identify the relevant objects and their positions relative to the object or position being asked about: {
        Identify the objects and their positions that are relevant to the object or position being asked about:,
    },
    Use the information to answer the question: {
        Use the information gathered to answer the question, such as identifying the color of an object or its position:,
    },
    If the question asks about the number of objects: {
        Count the number of objects that meet the specified criteria:,
    },
    If the question asks about the color of an object: {
        Identify the color of the object based on the information gathered:,
    },
}
