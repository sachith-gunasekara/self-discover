Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    Identify the key question being asked: {
        Determine the specific information needed to answer the question:,
    },
    Identify the objects and their relevant characteristics: {
        Determine the colors, locations, and quantities of the objects:,
    },
    Simplify the problem by focusing on a specific aspect: {
        Identify the relevant objects and characteristics to focus on:,
    },
    Break down the problem into smaller parts: {
        Identify the objects, their locations, and the actions involved:,
    },
    Analyze the problem step by step: {
        Consider the initial state, any actions taken, and the resulting state:,
    },
    Determine the solution based on the analysis: {
        Use the relevant information to arrive at a solution:,
    },
    Identify the specific object or characteristic being asked about: {
        Determine the color, location, or quantity of the object:,
    },
    Determine if any actions change the state of the objects: {
        Identify if any objects are removed, added, or changed:,
    },
    Determine the resulting state of the objects after any actions: {
        Identify the final colors, locations, and quantities of the objects:,
    },
}
```

However, to make it more concrete and applicable to the given task examples, here is a more detailed and operationalized reasoning plan:

```
{
    Identify the key question being asked: {
        Determine if the question is asking about the color, location, or quantity of an object:,
    },
    Identify the objects and their relevant characteristics: {
        Determine the colors of the objects:,
        Determine the locations of the objects:,
        Determine the quantities of the objects:,
    },
    Simplify the problem by focusing on a specific aspect: {
        If the question is asking about color, focus on the colors of the objects:,
        If the question is asking about location, focus on the locations of the objects:,
        If the question is asking about quantity, focus on the quantities of the objects:,
    },
    Determine if any actions change the state of the objects: {
        Identify if any objects are removed:,
        Identify if any objects are added:,
        Identify if any objects are changed:,
    },
    Determine the resulting state of the objects after any actions: {
        If objects are removed, subtract the removed objects from the initial state:,
        If objects are added, add the new objects to the initial state:,
        If objects are changed, update the characteristics of the changed objects:,
    },
    Determine the solution based on the analysis: {
        Use the resulting state of the objects to answer the key question:,
    },
}
```

This reasoning plan can be applied to the given task examples to arrive at the correct answers.
