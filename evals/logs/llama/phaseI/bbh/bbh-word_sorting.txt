Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    Identify the list of words to be sorted: {
        Extract the list of words from the problem statement:,
    },
    Determine the primary goal or objective: {
        Identify the goal as sorting the list of words alphabetically:,
    },
    Simplify the task by identifying common characteristics: {
        Identify the common characteristic as alphabetical order:,
    },
    Break down the list into smaller, more manageable groups: {
        Group words by starting letter or prefix:,
    },
    Create a step-by-step plan to sort the words: {
        Step 1: Identify the starting letter of each word:,
        Step 2: Compare words with the same starting letter:,
        Step 3: Double-check the sorted list for accuracy:,
    },
    Execute the step-by-step plan: {
        Iterate through the list of words and apply the steps:,
    },
    Verify the sorted list: {
        Check the list for accuracy and completeness:,
    },
}
