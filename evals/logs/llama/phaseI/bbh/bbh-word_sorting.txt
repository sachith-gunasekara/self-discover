Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    Write down the list of words: {},
    Identify the first word and its starting letter: {},
    Compare the first word to the next word and determine which one comes first alphabetically: {},
    Continue comparing and rearranging the words until the entire list is in alphabetical order: {
        Iterate through the list of words: {
            Compare the current word to the next word: {},
            If the current word comes before the next word alphabetically, move to the next word: {},
            If the current word comes after the next word alphabetically, swap the two words: {},
        },
    },
    Double-check the list to ensure that it is accurate and complete: {
        Iterate through the list of words again: {
            Verify that each word is in its correct alphabetical order: {},
        },
    },
}
```
