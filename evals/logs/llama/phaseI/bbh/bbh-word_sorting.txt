Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    "Step 1: Identify the core issue or problem": {
        "Identify the task as an alphabetical sorting problem": {}
    },
    "Step 2: Simplify the problem": {
        "Look for patterns or common characteristics among the items to be sorted": {}
    },
    "Step 3: Break down the list of words": {
        "Divide the list into smaller groups, such as words starting with the same letter or prefix": {}
    },
    "Step 4: Determine the sorting criteria": {
        "Identify the key characteristics that need to be considered, such as alphabetical order or word length": {}
    },
    "Step 5: Create a step-by-step plan": {
        "Start with the first word in the list and compare it to the next word, and then the next": {},
        "Compare each word to the next, considering the identified sorting criteria": {},
        "Double-check the sorted list to ensure accuracy": {}
    },
    "Step 6: Implement the plan": {
        "Arrange the words in alphabetical order, using the identified sorting criteria": {}
    },
    "Step 7: Verify the solution": {
        "Review the sorted list to ensure that each word is in its correct alphabetical position": {}
    }
}
```

This operationalized reasoning plan provides a general structure for solving alphabetical sorting tasks, and can be applied to the provided task examples.
