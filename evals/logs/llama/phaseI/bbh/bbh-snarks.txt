Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    "Step 1: Analyze the tone, language, and context of the statements": {
        "Identify potential indicators of sarcasm": [
            "Look for irony, understatement, or exaggeration",
            "Consider the use of rhetorical questions or hyperbole"
        ]
    },
    "Step 2: Simplify the problem by identifying key elements": {
        "Focus on the aspects that may indicate sarcasm": [
            "Irony, understatement, or exaggeration",
            "Inconsistencies between the literal meaning and the tone"
        ]
    },
    "Step 3: Consider alternative perspectives or viewpoints": {
        "Evaluate multiple possible interpretations of the statement": [
            "Literal, ironic, and sarcastic meanings"
        ]
    },
    "Step 4: Identify the core issue or problem": {
        "Determine whether a statement is sarcastic or not": [
            "Focus on the key factors that influence that determination"
        ]
    },
    "Step 5: Break down the statement into its component parts": {
        "Analyze each part for potential indicators of sarcasm": [
            "Look for cues that indicate irony or understatement"
        ]
    },
    "Step 6: Synthesize the results to make a determination about the overall tone of the statement": {
        "Consider the nuances of language, tone, and context": [
            "Take into account the complexities of language and social context"
        ]
    },
    "Step 7: Compare the options and select the one that is most likely to be sarcastic": {
        "Use the results of the analysis to make a final determination": [
            "Choose the option that best aligns with the indicators of sarcasm"
        ]
    }
}
