Here's a step-by-step reasoning plan in JSON format for the given task examples:

```
{
    Evaluate the mathematical expression step-by-step: {
        Identify the core operations involved in the expression: {
            Determine the order of operations (parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division, addition and subtraction):
        },
        Break down the complex expression into smaller parts: {
            Identify individual calculations or operations within the expression:
        },
        Analyze the expression from different perspectives: {
            Evaluate the numerical values or information available:
        },
        Evaluate each operation in the correct order: {
            Start with parentheses, then exponents, then multiplication and division, and finally addition and subtraction:
        },
        Simplify expressions and solve equations as needed: {
            Apply algebraic or arithmetic operations to simplify the expression:
        },
        Combine the results of individual calculations: {
            Implement a clear and logical sequence of calculations and explanations:
        },
        Finalize the solution: {
            Evaluate the final result of the expression:
        },
    },
}
```
