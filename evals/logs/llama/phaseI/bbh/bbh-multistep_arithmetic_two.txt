Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    "Evaluate the expression step by step": {
        "Identify the operations and their order": {
            "Determine if the expression contains parentheses, multiplication, division, addition, or subtraction"
        },
        "Simplify expressions inside parentheses": {
            "Apply order of operations inside each set of parentheses"
        },
        "Apply multiplication and division operations from left to right": {
            "Evaluate each multiplication and division operation in order"
        },
        "Apply addition and subtraction operations from left to right": {
            "Evaluate each addition and subtraction operation in order"
        },
        "Combine like terms and simplify the expression": {
            "Cancel out operations or apply mathematical properties such as the distributive property"
        }
    }
}
```

This reasoning plan can be applied to each of the task examples provided. It involves identifying the operations and their order, simplifying expressions inside parentheses, applying multiplication and division operations, applying addition and subtraction operations, and combining like terms to simplify the expression.
