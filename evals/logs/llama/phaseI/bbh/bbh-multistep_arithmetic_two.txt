Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    Determine the core mathematical operations and order of operations: {
        Identify the operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and their order in the expression:,
    },
    Simplify the expression by combining like terms and canceling out opposing operations: {
        Combine like terms (e.g., constants, variables with the same coefficient):,
        Cancel out opposing operations (e.g., addition and subtraction of the same value):,
    },
    Break down the complex expression into smaller parts: {
        Isolate individual operations or group similar terms together:,
    },
    Evaluate the expression step by step: {
        Follow the order of operations and apply mathematical rules and identities as needed:,
    },
    Apply critical thinking: {
        Analyze the expression from different mathematical perspectives:,
        Question assumptions about the order of operations:,
        Evaluate the mathematical evidence or information available:,
    },
    Determine the type of problem: {
        Is the problem numerical (requiring arithmetic operations) or algebraic (requiring manipulation of equations or expressions)?:,
    },
    Create a step-by-step plan to simplify the expression: {
        Implement mathematical operations and rules with clear notation and explanation:,
    },
    Final evaluation: {
        Evaluate the simplified expression to arrive at the final answer:,
    },
}
```

However, to make it more concrete and directly applicable to the given task examples, here is a more detailed and structured version:

```
{
    Step 1: Evaluate expressions inside parentheses: {
        Follow the order of operations inside each set of parentheses:,
    },
    Step 2: Simplify expressions with multiplication and division: {
        Evaluate multiplication and division operations from left to right:,
    },
    Step 3: Simplify expressions with addition and subtraction: {
        Evaluate addition and subtraction operations from left to right:,
    },
    Step 4: Combine like terms: {
        Combine constants and variables with the same coefficient:,
    },
    Step 5: Final evaluation: {
        Evaluate the simplified expression to arrive at the final answer:,
    },
}
```

This structure can be applied to the given task examples to arrive at the correct answers.
