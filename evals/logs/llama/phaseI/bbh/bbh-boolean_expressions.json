    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. Critical Thinking: Analyze the logical expression from different perspectives, considering the order of operations and the impact of each logical operator (AND, OR, NOT) on the overall expression.\n\n4. Simplification: Identify opportunities to simplify the expression by removing unnecessary parentheses, applying logical equivalences (e.g., NOT NOT A = A), or combining like terms.\n\n9. Problem Decomposition: Break down complex logical expressions into smaller sub-expressions, evaluating each component separately before combining them to form the final result.\n\n13. Systems Thinking: Consider the logical expression as part of a larger system of Boolean logic, recognizing patterns and relationships between different components and applying logical rules to derive the solution.\n\n16. Core Issue Identification: Identify the key logical operators and operands in the expression, focusing on the relationships between them to determine the overall value of the expression.\n\n25. Technical Expertise: Apply knowledge of Boolean logic and logical operators to evaluate the expression, considering the specific rules and properties of each operator (e.g., commutativity, associativity, distributivity).\n\n30. Design Challenge: Approach the logical expression as a design challenge, seeking creative ways to simplify or reorganize the expression to reveal its underlying structure and solution.\n\n34. Alternative Solutions: Consider alternative ways to evaluate the logical expression, using different sequences of operations or applying logical equivalences to derive the solution.\n\n38. Step-by-Step Analysis: Evaluate the logical expression step-by-step, applying the order of operations and carefully considering the impact of each logical operator on the overall expression.",
