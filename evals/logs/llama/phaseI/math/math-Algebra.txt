Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
  "Critical Thinking": {
    "Analyze the problem statement": {},
    "Identify key concepts and relationships": {}
  },
  "Identify Core Issue": {
    "Determine the central problem or objective": {},
    "Clarify what needs to be solved or optimized": {}
  },
  "Problem Decomposition": {
    "Break down the problem into smaller parts": {},
    "Identify relevant information and constraints": {}
  },
  "Assumption Evaluation": {
    "Recognize and challenge assumptions": {},
    "Ensure accuracy and relevance of information": {}
  },
  "Mathematical Modeling": {
    "Apply algebraic, geometric, or other mathematical techniques": {},
    "Represent and solve the problem": {}
  },
  "Pattern Recognition": {
    "Identify patterns, relationships, or structures": {},
    "Inform solutions or conclusions": {}
  },
  "Logical Deduction": {
    "Use logical reasoning and mathematical principles": {},
    "Deduce solutions or conclusions": {}
  },
  "Analytical Reasoning": {
    "Apply mathematical concepts and techniques": {},
    "Analyze and solve the problem": {}
  },
  "Quantitative Analysis": {
    "Apply mathematical techniques to quantify and analyze data": {},
    "Identify trends, patterns, or correlations": {}
  },
  "Algebraic Manipulation": {
    "Apply algebraic techniques to solve the problem": {},
    "Manipulate equations and expressions": {}
  },
  "Geometric Reasoning": {
    "Apply geometric concepts and techniques": {},
    "Visualize and solve the problem": {}
  },
  "Solution Verification": {
    "Check the solution for accuracy and completeness": {},
    "Ensure the solution meets the problem requirements": {}
  }
}
```

However, the above structure may be too general and not specific enough to guide solvers through the problem-solving process. Here is a more detailed and specific structure:

```
{
  "Step 1: Problem Explanation": {
    "Read and understand the problem statement": {},
    "Identify key concepts and relationships": {}
  },
  "Step 2: Problem Decomposition": {
    "Break down the problem into smaller parts": {},
    "Identify relevant information and constraints": {}
  },
  "Step 3: Mathematical Modeling": {
    "Apply algebraic, geometric, or other mathematical techniques": {},
    "Represent and solve the problem": {}
  },
  "Step 4: Solution Derivation": {
    "Use logical reasoning and mathematical principles": {},
    "Deduce solutions or conclusions": {}
  },
  "Step 5: Solution Verification": {
    "Check the solution for accuracy and completeness": {},
    "Ensure the solution meets the problem requirements": {}
  },
  "Step 6: Solution Refining": {
    "Refine the solution based on feedback or new information": {},
    "Ensure the solution is optimal and effective": {}
  }
}
```

However, the best structure would be one that is tailored to the specific problem domain and the type of problems being solved. Here is a more detailed structure for the math problem domain:

```
{
  "Step 1: Problem Explanation": {
    "Read and understand the problem statement": {},
    "Identify key concepts and relationships": {}
  },
  "Step 2: Equation Identification": {
    "Identify the relevant equations and formulas": {},
    "Determine the unknown variables and constants": {}
  },
  "Step 3: Algebraic Manipulation": {
    "Apply algebraic techniques to solve the problem": {},
    "Manipulate equations and expressions": {}
  },
  "Step 4: Solution Derivation": {
    "Use logical reasoning and mathematical principles": {},
    "Deduce solutions or conclusions": {}
  },
  "Step 5: Solution Verification": {
    "Check the solution for accuracy and completeness": {},
    "Ensure the solution meets the problem requirements": {}
  },
  "Step 6: Solution Simplification": {
    "Simplify the solution to its most basic form": {},
    "Ensure the solution is easy to understand and apply": {}
  }
}
```
