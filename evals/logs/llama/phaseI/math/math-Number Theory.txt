Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    "Step 1: Analyze the Problem": {
        "Identify Key Assumptions": "Determine the underlying mathematical assumptions, definitions, and principles that apply to the problem.",
        "Identify Underlying Causes": "Recognize the underlying mathematical structures, patterns, and relationships that contribute to the problem."
    },
    "Step 2: Break Down the Problem": {
        "Decompose Complex Problems": "Break down complex mathematical problems into smaller, more manageable parts, identifying key variables, relationships, and constraints.",
        "Identify Relevant Data and Information": "Identify relevant mathematical data and information that can provide insights into the problem."
    },
    "Step 3: Identify Solution Strategies": {
        "Typical Solution Types": "Identify common mathematical solution strategies, techniques, and tools that are typically applied to similar problems.",
        "Expertise and Skill Set": "Recognize the mathematical expertise and skill set required to solve the problem."
    },
    "Step 4: Apply Mathematical Reasoning": {
        "Step-by-Step Reasoning": "Apply step-by-step mathematical reasoning, breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts, and using logical deductions and mathematical derivations to arrive at a solution.",
        "Alternative Perspectives": "Consider different mathematical representations, models, and approaches to gain insights into the problem."
    },
    "Step 5: Evaluate and Refine the Solution": {
        "Reflective Thinking": "Step back from mathematical problems, taking time for introspection and self-reflection to identify key insights, errors, and areas for improvement.",
        "Core Issue Identification": "Identify the core mathematical issue or problem that needs to be addressed."
    }
}
```

This reasoning structure is designed to be general and applicable to a wide range of mathematical problems, including those provided in the task examples. It provides a step-by-step approach to analyzing problems, breaking them down into manageable parts, identifying solution strategies, applying mathematical reasoning, and evaluating and refining the solution.
