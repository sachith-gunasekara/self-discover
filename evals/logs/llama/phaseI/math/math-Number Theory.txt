Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
  "Reasoning Plan": [
    {
      "Step 1: Analyze the Problem": {
        "Critical Thinking": "Analyze mathematical problems from different perspectives",
        "Identify Key Assumptions": "Determine underlying mathematical assumptions, definitions, or theorems"
      }
    },
    {
      "Step 2: Identify Key Factors": {
        "Underlying Causes": "Identify key factors or mathematical relationships",
        "Physical Constraints": "Consider mathematical constraints, such as limits, bounds, or restrictions"
      }
    },
    {
      "Step 3: Determine the Approach": {
        "Technical or Practical Problem": "Determine if the problem requires a specific mathematical technique",
        "Analytical Problem": "Identify if the problem requires mathematical analysis"
      }
    },
    {
      "Step 4: Break Down the Problem": {
        "Break Down the Problem": "Divide the problem into smaller, more manageable mathematical parts"
      }
    },
    {
      "Step 5: Identify Relevant Data": {
        "Relevant Data": "Identify any relevant mathematical data, information, or patterns"
      }
    },
    {
      "Step 6: Consider Alternative Solutions": {
        "Creative Thinking": "Generate innovative and out-of-the-box mathematical ideas or approaches",
        "Typical Solutions": "Consider the types of mathematical solutions that are typically produced"
      }
    },
    {
      "Step 7: Reflect on the Solution": {
        "Reflective Thinking": "Take a step back from the problem, reflect on the mathematical approaches or techniques used"
      }
    },
    {
      "Step 8: Execute the Solution": {
        "Step-by-Step Approach": "Break down the mathematical solution into a step-by-step process"
      }
    }
