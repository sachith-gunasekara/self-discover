Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
  "Reasoning Plan": {
    "Step 1: Analyze the Problem": {
      "Identify the problem type": "",
      "Determine the key elements": "",
      "Identify the constraints and assumptions": ""
    },
    "Step 2: Outline the Solution Strategy": {
      "Determine the relevant concepts and formulas": "",
      "Identify the necessary calculations and operations": "",
      "Decide on the approach to solve the problem": ""
    },
    "Step 3: Break Down the Problem": {
      "Divide the problem into smaller sub-problems": "",
      "Identify the key sub-problems and their relationships": "",
      "Determine the order in which to solve the sub-problems": ""
    },
    "Step 4: Solve the Sub-Problems": {
      "Apply the relevant concepts and formulas to each sub-problem": "",
      "Perform the necessary calculations and operations": "",
      "Check the results for each sub-problem": ""
    },
    "Step 5: Combine the Results": {
      "Combine the results of the sub-problems": "",
      "Apply any necessary adjustments or conversions": "",
      "Check the final result": ""
    },
    "Step 6: Evaluate the Result": {
      "Check the result for reasonableness": "",
      "Verify the result using alternative methods or checks": "",
      "Refine the result if necessary": ""
    }
  }
}
```

This reasoning plan is a general framework that can be applied to a wide range of mathematical problems, including those listed above. It provides a step-by-step approach to analyzing the problem, outlining the solution strategy, breaking down the problem, solving the sub-problems, combining the results, and evaluating the final result.
