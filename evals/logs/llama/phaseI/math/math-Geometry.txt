Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
  "Reasoning Plan": {
    "Step 1: Understand the Problem": {
      "Identify the problem type": "Geometry, Trigonometry, or Algebra",
      "Read and analyze the problem statement": "Identify key elements such as points, angles, shapes, and relationships"
    },
    "Step 2: Draw Diagrams and Visualize": {
      "Draw a diagram to represent the problem": "Use points, lines, angles, and shapes to visualize the problem",
      "Label key elements in the diagram": "Use variables and symbols to represent unknowns and knowns"
    },
    "Step 3: Identify Relevant Concepts and Formulas": {
      "Identify relevant geometric, trigonometric, or algebraic concepts": "Use properties of shapes, trigonometric identities, and algebraic formulas",
      "Recall formulas and theorems related to the problem": "Use formulas such as Pythagorean theorem, trigonometric identities, and algebraic equations"
    },
    "Step 4: Apply Reasoning and Problem-Solving Strategies": {
      "Use logical reasoning and problem-solving strategies": "Use strategies such as working backwards, using analogies, and making connections to other problems",
      "Apply geometric, trigonometric, or algebraic techniques": "Use techniques such as solving equations, finding patterns, and using symmetry"
    },
    "Step 5: Calculate and Solve": {
      "Perform calculations and solve equations": "Use arithmetic, algebraic, and trigonometric operations to solve for unknowns",
      "Check solutions and verify results": "Use plugging in values, checking units, and verifying with diagrams"
    },
    "Step 6: Answer the Question": {
      "Read the question carefully and answer what is asked": "Use the solution to answer the question, and make sure to include units and relevant information"
    }
  }
}
