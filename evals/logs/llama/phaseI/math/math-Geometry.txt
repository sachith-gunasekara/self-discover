Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
  "Reasoning Plan": [
    {
      "Step 1: Analyze the Problem": [
        "Identify the key elements of the problem, including the given information, unknown quantities, and overall objective.",
        "Determine the type of problem, such as geometric, algebraic, or a combination of both."
      ]
    },
    {
      "Step 2: Simplify the Problem": [
        "Look for symmetries, patterns, or invariant properties that can be used to simplify the problem.",
        "Identify any constraints or limitations that can help to reduce the complexity of the problem."
      ]
    },
    {
      "Step 3: Break Down the Problem": [
        "Divide the problem into smaller, more manageable parts, such as analyzing individual components or identifying key relationships.",
        "Isolate specific variables or quantities that need to be determined or optimized."
      ]
    },
    {
      "Step 4: Apply Geometric or Algebraic Concepts": [
        "Use geometric or algebraic concepts, such as similarity, congruence, or proportionality, to analyze and solve the problem.",
        "Apply mathematical formulas or theorems, such as the Pythagorean theorem or the triangle inequality, as needed."
      ]
    },
    {
      "Step 5: Analyze and Evaluate": [
        "Evaluate the solution or solutions obtained in the previous step.",
        "Check for any errors or inconsistencies, and revise the solution as needed."
      ]
    },
    {
      "Step 6: Draw Conclusions": [
        "Summarize the main findings and conclusions obtained from the analysis and evaluation.",
        "Provide a clear and concise answer to the problem, including any relevant explanations or justifications."
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

This reasoning plan is designed to be general and flexible, and can be applied to a wide range of problems, including those in geometry, algebra, and other areas of mathematics. It emphasizes the importance of analyzing the problem, simplifying it, breaking it down into manageable parts, applying geometric or algebraic concepts, evaluating and revising the solution, and drawing clear and concise conclusions.
