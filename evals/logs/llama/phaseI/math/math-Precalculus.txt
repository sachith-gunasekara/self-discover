Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
  "Reasoning Plan": {
    "Step 1: Analyze the Problem": {
      "Identify the problem type": "Is it a mathematical modeling challenge, a logical problem, or a mathematical computation problem?",
      "Determine the key elements": "What are the given information, unknown quantities, and overall objective?"
    },
    "Step 2: Outline the Solution Strategy": {
      "Determine the relevant mathematical concepts": "What mathematical principles, formulas, or theorems are applicable to the problem?",
      "Identify the problem-solving approach": "Is it a direct calculation, a logical deduction, or a creative solution?"
    },
    "Step 3: Break Down the Problem": {
      "Divide the problem into smaller parts": "Can the problem be decomposed into more manageable sub-problems?",
      "Identify the relationships between parts": "How do the sub-problems relate to each other and the overall objective?"
    },
    "Step 4: Apply Mathematical Concepts and Principles": {
      "Use mathematical formulas and theorems": "Apply relevant mathematical concepts to solve the sub-problems",
      "Make logical deductions": "Use logical reasoning to arrive at conclusions"
    },
    "Step 5: Combine the Results": {
      "Synthesize the solutions to sub-problems": "Combine the results of the sub-problems to arrive at the final answer",
      "Verify the solution": "Check the solution for correctness and consistency"
    }
  }
}
```

This reasoning plan provides a general framework for solving mathematical problems, including those presented in the task examples. It involves analyzing the problem, outlining the solution strategy, breaking down the problem, applying mathematical concepts and principles, and combining the results to arrive at the final answer.
