Here is an example of how these reasoning plans can be applied to a specific task:

Task: Tom got a Mr. Potato Head for his birthday. It came with 3 hairstyles, 2 sets of eyebrows, 1 pair of googly eyes, 2 sets of ears, and 2 sets of lips, a pair of regular shoes, and a bonus pair of clown shoes. If a complete Mr. Potato Head personality includes eyebrows, eyes, ears, lips, shoes and optionally hair, how many different wacky personalities can Tom come up with?

Reasoning Plan:
{
    Break down the problem into smaller sub-problems: {
        Identify the key elements such as variables, relationships, and constraints:,
        Determine the relationships between the sub-problems:,
    },
    Use mathematical concepts to solve the problem: {
        Apply mathematical formulas and equations:,
        Use mathematical functions and graphs:,
    },
    Evaluate the potential consequences of each step: {
        Identify potential risks and benefits:,
        Determine the feasibility of each step:,
    },
}

Solution:
{
    Break down the problem into smaller sub-problems: {
        Identify the key elements: 3 hairstyles, 2 sets of eyebrows, 1 pair of googly eyes, 2 sets of ears, and 2 sets of lips, a pair of regular shoes, and a bonus pair of clown shoes:,
        Determine the relationships: each personality requires eyebrows, eyes, ears, lips, shoes, and optionally hair:,
    },
    Use mathematical concepts to solve the problem: {
        Apply mathematical formulas: 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x (3 + 1) = 64:,
    },
    Evaluate the potential consequences of each step: {
        Identify potential risks: none:,
        Determine the feasibility: the calculation is feasible:,
    },
}

Answer: 64.
