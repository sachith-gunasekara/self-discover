Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
  "Step 1: Understand the Problem": {
    "Identify the key elements of the problem": {},
    "Determine the core mathematical concept or problem": {}
  },
  "Step 2: Simplify the Problem": {
    "Break down the problem into smaller, more manageable parts": {},
    "Identify and eliminate irrelevant information": {}
  },
  "Step 3: Identify Relevant Mathematical Concepts": {
    "Determine the underlying mathematical relationships or principles": {},
    "Identify relevant mathematical formulas, theorems, or concepts": {}
  },
  "Step 4: Develop a Solution Plan": {
    "Decompose the problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems": {},
    "Identify the key steps needed to solve each sub-problem": {}
  },
  "Step 5: Implement the Solution Plan": {
    "Use mathematical logic and reasoning to develop a solution": {},
    "Apply relevant mathematical concepts and techniques": {}
  },
  "Step 6: Evaluate and Refine the Solution": {
    "Check the solution for accuracy and completeness": {},
    "Refine the solution as needed": {}
  }
}
```

This reasoning structure is designed to be general enough to be applied to a wide range of mathematical problems, including those listed above. It provides a step-by-step framework for solvers to follow, from understanding the problem to evaluating and refining the solution.
