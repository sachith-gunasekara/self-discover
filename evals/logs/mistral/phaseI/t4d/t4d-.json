How can I break down this problem into smaller, more manageable parts?\n10. Critical Thinking: This style involves analyzing the problem from different perspectives, questioning assumptions, and evaluating the evidence or information available. It focuses on logical reasoning, evidence-based decision-making, and identifying potential biases or flaws in thinking.\n21. What are the stakeholders or individuals who are directly affected by the problem? What are their perspectives and needs?\n23. How can progress or success in solving the problem be measured or evaluated?\n24. What indicators or metrics can be used?\n28. Does the problem involve decision-making or planning, where choices need to be made under uncertainty or with competing objectives?\n38. Let's think step by step.\n39. Let's make a step by step plan and implement it with good notion and explanation.",
    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions to better solve tasks like those given above:\n\n1. **Identify the core task**: What is the main question or task that needs to be answered or solved?\n2. **Understand the context**: What are the key events and actions described in the observation that are relevant to the task?\n3. **Break down the observation**: How can I segment the observation into smaller, sequential, or categorical parts to analyze it more effectively?\n10. **Analyze perspectives**: Consider the actions, plans, and preferences of each individual mentioned in the observation. Question any assumptions about their knowledge or intentions.\n21. **Identify relevant individuals**: Who are the individuals directly involved in or affected by the task or plan mentioned in the observation? What are their needs and current knowledge based on the given information?\n23. **Define useful information**: What information would be beneficial for an individual to know to facilitate their plans or tasks?\n24. **Establish relevance**: What details from the observation are relevant to the task and could serve as helpful information for the identified individuals?\n28. **Evaluate uncertainty**: Does the task involve decisions or plans that could be affected by unknown factors or competing objectives among the individuals?\n38. **Sequentially process**: Let's analyze the observation step by step, considering each individual's actions and the task's requirements.\n39. **Formulate a solution**: Let's create a step-by-step plan to determine who would benefit from receiving helpful information, supported by clear reasoning.",
