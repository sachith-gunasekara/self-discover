It focuses on logical reasoning, evidence-based decision-making, and identifying potential biases or flaws in thinking.\n17 What are the underlying causes or factors contributing to the problem?\n21 What are the potential obstacles or challenges that might arise in solving this problem?\n27 Is the problem related to human behavior, such as a social, cultural, or psychological issue?\n28 Does the problem involve decision-making or planning, where choices need to be made under uncertainty or with competing objectives?\n38 Let's think step by step.\n39 Let's make a step by step plan and implement it with good notion and explanation.",
