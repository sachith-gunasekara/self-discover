    "Analytical Problem Identification": {
        "Identify the problem type": "Determine if the problem requires creating a systematic or mathematical representation, such as a ranking or ordering system, to analyze the relationships between objects."
    },
    "Problem Decomposition": {
        "Break down the problem": "Break down the ordering problem into smaller, more manageable parts, such as individual pairs or small groups of objects, to analyze their relationships one at a time."
