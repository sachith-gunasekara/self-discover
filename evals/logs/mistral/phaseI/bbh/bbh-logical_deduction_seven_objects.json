It focuses on logical reasoning, evidence-based decision-making, and identifying potential biases or flaws in thinking.\n16 What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed?\n17 What are the underlying causes or factors contributing to the problem?\n20 Are there any relevant data or information that can provide insights into the problem? If yes, what data sources are available, and how can they be analyzed?\n29 Is the problem an analytical one that requires data analysis, modeling, or optimization techniques?\n38 Let's think step by step.\n39 Let's make a step by step plan and implement it with good notion and explanation.",
    "adapted_modules": "1. **Break down the problem into smaller parts**: Identify each object and the statements that describe their order. List these statements and objects separately.\n\n2. **Critical Thinking**: Analyze the problem by considering each perspective (e.g., oldest to newest, left to right, cheapest to most expensive). Question assumptions about the order and evaluate the information given to ensure logical consistency. Identify any biases or flaws in the reasoning, such as contradictory statements.\n\n3. **Identify the core issue**: Determine what specific order or position needs to be found (e.g., fourth-newest, third-cheapest, second from the left).\n\n4. **Understand underlying causes/factors**: Recognize the relationships between the objects based on the given statements (e.g., A is older than B, X is to the left of Y).\n\n5. **Relevant data and analysis**: Identify the key data points that provide insights into the problem (e.g., the sedan is the third-oldest, the blue jay is the second from the right). Analyze these data points in the context of the problem's core issue.\n\n6. **Analytical problem identification**: Determine if the problem requires creating a sequence or order based on given statements and if a step-by-step analysis can help derive the solution.\n\n7. **Step-by-step reasoning**: Approach the problem by sequentially evaluating each statement and its implications for the order of the objects.\n\n8. **Step-by-step planning and implementation**: Create a plan that involves ordering the objects based on the given statements, using clear notation and explanation. Implement this plan step by step, ensuring each object's position is logically deduced from the available information.",
