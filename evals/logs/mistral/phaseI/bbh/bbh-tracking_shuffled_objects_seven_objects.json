Then, list each swap or trade chronologically.\n\n2. **Identify the core question**: Determine who or what is the focus at the end of the sequence of swaps or trades.\n\n3. **Review past solutions**: Consider if there are any patterns or strategies from previous similar problems that can be applied, and what was learned from them.\n\n4. **Check for decision-making or planning**: Recognize if the problem involves tracking changes and making sequential updates based on given rules.\n\n5. **Step-by-step breakdown**: Carefully go through each swap or trade one at a time, updating the status of each person and their respective partner or item.\n\n6. **Create and implement a step-by-step plan**: Develop a clear strategy to track each swap or trade methodically, ensuring each step is logically followed and documented.",
