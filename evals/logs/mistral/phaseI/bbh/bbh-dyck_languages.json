It focuses on logical reasoning, evidence-based decision-making, and identifying potential biases or flaws in thinking.\n13 Use systems thinking: Consider the problem as part of a larger system and understanding the interconnectedness of various elements. Focuses on identifying the underlying causes, feedback loops, and interdependencies that influence the problem, and developing holistic solutions that address the system as a whole.\n29 Is the problem an analytical one that requires data analysis, modeling, or optimization techniques?\n38 Let's think step by step.\n39 Let's make a step by step plan and implement it with good notion and explanation.",

Identify the underlying patterns, dependencies, and feedback loops that influence how each bracket is closed.\n\n5. **Analytical Problem**: Does this problem require tracking and analyzing the count of open and closed brackets, potentially using a stack-based model to optimize the solution?\n\n6. **Step-by-Step Thinking**: Let's close each open bracket one at a time, ensuring the sequence remains valid at every step.\n\n7. **Step-by-Step Planning**: Create a step-by-step plan to close the brackets, clearly explaining each step and ensuring the sequence is properly managed with a good understanding of the process.",
