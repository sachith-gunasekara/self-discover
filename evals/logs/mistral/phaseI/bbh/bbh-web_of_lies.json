    "selected_modules": "To solve the given task examples, the following reasoning modules are crucial:\n\n1. How can I break down this problem into smaller, more manageable parts?\n2. Make a list of ideas for solving this problem, and apply them one by one to the problem to see if any progress can be made.\n3. Critical Thinking: This style involves analyzing the problem from different perspectives, questioning assumptions, and evaluating the evidence or information available. It focuses on logical reasoning, evidence-based decision-making, and identifying potential biases or flaws in thinking.\n4. What are the key assumptions underlying this problem?\n5. What are the alternative perspectives or viewpoints on this problem?\n6. What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed?\n7. Let's think step by step.\n8. Let's make a step by step plan and implement it with good notion and explanation.",
    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning modules to better solve the given tasks:\n\n1. **Break down the sequence of statements**: Identify each person's statement and their implications one at a time.\n2. **Evaluate each statement's truth value**: Make a list of possibilities (true or false) for each person's statement, starting with the initial person mentioned, and propagate the implications down the chain.\n3. **Critical Thinking: Logical Consistency**: Analyze the chain of statements for logical consistency. Identify any contradictions or inconsistencies that may arise from assuming a truth value for a particular statement.\n4. **Identify key assumptions**: Determine if each person is assumed to be telling the truth or lying, based on the given information.\n5. **Consider alternative truth-value assignments**: Explore different scenarios by assigning alternative truth values to each person's statement and trace the implications.\n6. **Identify the core statement to be evaluated**: Clearly state the final person's statement that needs to be verified as true or false.\n7. **Step-by-step truth-value propagation**: Trace the implications of each person's statement step by step, from the first to the last person in the sequence.\n8. **Create and execute a step-by-step plan**: Develop a clear plan to evaluate each statement systematically, and execute it with careful attention to logical dependencies and implications.",
