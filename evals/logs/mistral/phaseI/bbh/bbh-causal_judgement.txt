    "Step 1: Core Causal Issue": {
        "Identify the key causal relationship or question that needs to be addressed:"
    },
    "Step 2: Problem Decomposition": {
        "Break down the causality problem into smaller, more manageable parts, such as individual actions, events, or factors:"
    },
    "Step 3: Assumption Analysis": {
        "Identify implicit or explicit assumptions about responsibility, causality, or normal behavior in this problem:"
    },
    "Step 4: Perspective Shifting": {
        "Consider alternative viewpoints or interpretations of the events, actions, and responsibilities in this problem:"
