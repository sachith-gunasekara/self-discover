It focuses on logical reasoning, evidence-based decision-making, and identifying potential biases or flaws in thinking.\n16 What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed?\n17 What are the underlying causes or factors contributing to the problem?\n20 Are there any relevant data or information that can provide insights into the problem? If yes, what data sources are available, and how can they be analyzed?\n21 Are there any stakeholders or individuals who are directly affected by the problem? What are their perspectives and needs?\n25 Is the problem a technical or practical one that requires a specific expertise or skill set? Or is it more of a conceptual or theoretical problem?\n29 Is the problem an analytical one that requires data analysis, modeling, or optimization techniques?\n38 Let's think step by step.\n39 Let's make a step by step plan and implement it with good notion and explanation.",
