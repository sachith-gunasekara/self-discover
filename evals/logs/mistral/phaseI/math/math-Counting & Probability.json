It focuses on logical reasoning, evidence-based decision-making, and identifying potential biases or flaws in thinking.\n11 Try creative thinking, generate innovative and out-of-the-box ideas to solve the problem. Explore unconventional solutions, thinking beyond traditional boundaries, and encouraging imagination and originality.\n16 What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed?\n20 Are there any relevant data or information that can provide insights into the problem? If yes, what data sources are available, and how can they be analyzed?\n23 How can progress or success in solving the problem be measured or evaluated?\n25 Is the problem a technical or practical one that requires a specific expertise or skill set? Or is it more of a conceptual or theoretical problem?\n29 Is the problem an analytical one that requires data analysis, modeling, or optimization techniques?\n38 Let's think step by step.\n39 Let's make a step by step plan and implement it with good notion and explanation.",
