What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed?\n4. How can I simplify the problem so that it is easier to solve?\n9. How can I break down this problem into smaller, more manageable parts?\n10. Critical Thinking: This style involves analyzing the problem from different perspectives, questioning assumptions, and evaluating the evidence or information available.\n16. What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed?\n17. What are the underlying causes or factors contributing to the problem?\n20. Are there any relevant data or information that can provide insights into the problem? If yes, what data sources are available, and how can they be analyzed?\n21. Are there any stakeholders or individuals who are directly affected by the problem? What are their perspectives and needs?\n38. Let's think step by step.\n39. Let's make a step by step plan and implement it with good notion and explanation.",
    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed in the given scenario, and who are the key individuals involved?\n\n4. How can I simplify the problem by focusing on the essential actions and interactions between individuals in the scenario?\n\n9. How can I break down this problem into smaller parts, such as identifying the individuals' movements, actions, and interests, to better understand the situation?\n\n10. Critical Thinking: Analyze the scenario from different perspectives, questioning assumptions about the individuals' intentions and relationships, and evaluating the available information to identify patterns and connections.\n\n16. What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed, and how does it relate to the individuals' plans and interests?\n\n17. What are the underlying causes or factors contributing to the problem, such as the individuals' preferences, dislikes, or goals?\n\n20. Are there any relevant data or information in the scenario that can provide insights into the problem, such as the individuals' actions, movements, or interactions?\n\n21. Are there any stakeholders or individuals who are directly affected by the problem, and what are their perspectives, needs, and interests in the scenario?\n\n38. Let's think step by step about the events in the scenario, analyzing the sequence of actions and interactions to identify key patterns and connections.\n\n39. Let's make a step-by-step plan to analyze the scenario, identifying the key individuals, actions, and interests, and implementing a logical approach to solve the problem.",
