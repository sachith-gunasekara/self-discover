    "selected_modules": "Based on the task examples provided, the following reasoning modules are crucial for solving tasks like them:\n\n1. Critical Thinking: This style involves analyzing the problem from different perspectives, questioning assumptions, and evaluating the evidence or information available.\n4. How can I simplify the problem so that it is easier to solve?\n5. What are the key assumptions underlying this problem?\n10. Critical Thinking \n16. What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed?\n25. Is the problem a technical or practical one that requires a specific expertise or skill set? Or is it more of a conceptual or theoretical problem?\n30. Is the problem a design challenge that requires creative solutions and innovation?\n38. Let's think step by step.",
    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. Critical Thinking: Analyze the sentence structure, word choice, and context to identify the antecedent of the pronoun, considering multiple possible interpretations and evaluating the evidence or information available.\n\n4. Simplification: Break down complex sentences into simpler components to isolate the pronoun and its potential antecedents, making it easier to identify the correct relationship.\n\n5. Assumption Identification: Recognize assumptions about the pronoun's antecedent based on sentence structure, word order, and contextual clues, and evaluate their validity.\n\n10. Critical Thinking: Evaluate the sentence as a whole, considering the relationships between words, phrases, and clauses to determine the most likely antecedent of the pronoun.\n\n16. Core Issue Identification: Identify the central issue of pronoun ambiguity and focus on resolving it by analyzing the sentence's syntax, semantics, and pragmatics.\n\n25. Expertise Evaluation: Determine if the problem requires specialized knowledge of linguistics, grammar, or syntax to resolve the pronoun ambiguity, or if general critical thinking skills are sufficient.\n\n30. Creative Solution Generation: Consider alternative sentence structures, word choices, or contextual clues that could help disambiguate the pronoun's antecedent, and evaluate their effectiveness.\n\n38. Step-by-Step Analysis: Systematically analyze the sentence, starting with the pronoun and working backward to identify potential antecedents, considering each word and phrase in relation to the pronoun.",
