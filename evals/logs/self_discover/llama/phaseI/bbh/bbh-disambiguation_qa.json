    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. Critical Thinking: Analyze the sentence structure, word choice, and context to identify potential ambiguities in pronoun references. Evaluate the relationships between nouns and pronouns to determine the most likely antecedent.\n\n4. Simplifying the Problem: Break down complex sentences into simpler components to isolate the pronoun and its potential antecedents. Identify key phrases or clauses that may influence the pronoun's reference.\n\n16. Identifying the Core Issue: Determine the central question or problem in the sentence, which is often related to identifying the correct antecedent of a pronoun. Focus on the relationships between nouns and pronouns to resolve the ambiguity.\n\n17. Underlying Causes or Factors: Consider the grammatical rules, sentence structure, and contextual clues that may contribute to the ambiguity of the pronoun reference. Identify any biases or assumptions that may influence the interpretation.\n\n20. Relevant Data or Information: Look for contextual clues, such as possessive adjectives, verb agreement, or parallel structure, that can provide insights into the pronoun's reference. Consider any background knowledge or common sense that may help disambiguate the pronoun.\n\n25. Technical or Practical Expertise: Recognize the importance of grammatical knowledge, linguistic conventions, and idiomatic expressions in resolving pronoun ambiguities. Apply technical expertise in linguistics or language teaching to inform the analysis.\n\n38. Step-by-Step Thinking: Systematically analyze the sentence, starting with the pronoun and working backward to identify potential antecedents. Evaluate each possible antecedent in turn, considering the grammatical and contextual evidence that supports or contradicts each option.",
