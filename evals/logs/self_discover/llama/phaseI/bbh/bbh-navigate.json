How can I break down this problem into smaller, more manageable parts?\n10. Critical Thinking: This style involves analyzing the problem from different perspectives, questioning assumptions, and evaluating the evidence or information available.\n13. Use systems thinking: Consider the problem as part of a larger system and understanding the interconnectedness of various elements.\n16. What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed?\n38. Let's think step by step.\n39. Let's make a step by step plan and implement it with good notion and explanation.",
    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. How could I devise a step-by-step simulation to help visualize and solve the problem, considering the given instructions and possible movements?\n\n4. How can I simplify the instructions by identifying and canceling out opposing movements, such as turning around twice or taking steps in opposite directions?\n\n9. How can I break down the instructions into smaller parts, analyzing the effects of each movement or turn on the overall position and orientation?\n\n10. Critical Thinking: This style involves analyzing the instructions from different perspectives, questioning assumptions about the starting point and orientation, and evaluating the evidence or information available about the movements and turns.\n\n13. Use spatial thinking: Consider the problem as part of a larger spatial system, understanding the interconnectedness of various movements and turns, and how they affect the overall position and orientation.\n\n16. What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed, such as determining whether the final position is the same as the starting point?\n\n38. Let's analyze the instructions step by step, tracking the changes in position and orientation after each movement or turn.\n\n39. Let's make a step-by-step plan to simulate the instructions, using a systematic approach to track the movements and turns, and determine the final position and orientation.",
