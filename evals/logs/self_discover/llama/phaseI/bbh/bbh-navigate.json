Let's make a step by step plan and implement it with good notion and explanation.\n3. What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed?\n4. Break down this problem into smaller, more manageable parts.\n5. Analyze the problem from different perspectives, questioning assumptions, and evaluating the evidence or information available.\n9. How can I break down this problem into smaller, more manageable parts?\n38. Let's think step by step.\n39. Let's make a step by step plan and implement it with good notion and explanation.",
    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. Let's break down the instructions into individual steps and analyze each action.\n2. Create a step-by-step plan to visualize the movements and determine the final position.\n3. What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed: Do the instructions ultimately lead back to the starting point?\n4. Break down the problem into smaller parts: Analyze each instruction separately, considering the direction and number of steps.\n5. Analyze the problem from different perspectives: Consider the movements in relation to the starting point, taking into account any turns or changes in direction.\n9. How can I break down the sequence of instructions into manageable parts to track the movement and determine the final position?\n38. Let's analyze each step of the instructions to understand how they contribute to the overall movement.\n39. Create a step-by-step plan to track the movement and determine if the instructions ultimately lead back to the starting point.",
