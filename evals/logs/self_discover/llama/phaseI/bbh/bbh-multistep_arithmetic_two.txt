{
  "Step 1: Analyze the mathematical expression": {
    "Identify the core mathematical operations": {
      "Determine the correct order of operations": 
    },
    "Check for any patterns or relationships between numbers": {
      "Question any assumptions about the order of operations": 
    }
  },
  "Step 2: Simplify the expression": {
    "Combine like terms": {
      "Cancel out any zeros or negative signs": 
    },
    "Rearrange the numbers to make the calculations easier": {
      "Apply mathematical properties such as the distributive property": 
    }
  },
  "Step 3: Break down the complex mathematical expression": {
    "Identify individual calculations or groups of operations": {
      "Perform one calculation at a time": 
    },
    "Use the results to inform the next step in the solution process": {
      "Evaluate the mathematical properties being used": 
    }
  },
  "Step 4: Perform the calculations": {
    "Follow the order of operations": {
      "Apply mathematical rules and properties": 
    },
    "Check for any errors or inconsistencies": {
      "Verify the calculations": 
    }
  },
  "Step 5: Evaluate the final result": {
    "Check if the result is reasonable": {
      "Verify if the result is correct": 
    }
  }
