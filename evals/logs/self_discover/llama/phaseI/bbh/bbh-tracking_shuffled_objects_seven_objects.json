    "selected_modules": "Based on the task examples, the following reasoning modules are crucial for solving tasks like them:\n\n1. Let's think step by step.\n2. Let's make a step by step plan and implement it with good notion and explanation.\n3. Try creative thinking, generate innovative and out-of-the-box ideas to solve the problem. Explore unconventional solutions, thinking beyond traditional boundaries, and encouraging imagination and originality.\n4. What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed?\n5. How can I break down this problem into smaller, more manageable parts?\n6. What are the key assumptions underlying this problem?\n7. Critical Thinking: This style involves analyzing the problem from different perspectives, questioning assumptions, and evaluating the evidence or information available. It focuses on logical reasoning, evidence-based decision-making, and identifying potential biases or flaws in thinking.\n8. What kinds of solution typically are produced for this kind of problem specification?\n9. Given the problem specification and the current best solution, have a guess about other possible solutions.\n10. Make a list of ideas for solving this problem, and apply them one by one to the problem to see if any progress can be made.",
    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. Let's break down the sequence of events step by step to track the changes and updates.\n\n2. Create a systematic plan to follow the sequence of trades, swaps, or exchanges, and use a notation system to keep track of the updates.\n\n3. Consider unconventional ways to represent the sequence of events, such as using diagrams, charts, or tables to visualize the changes.\n\n4. Identify the key elements that are being exchanged or swapped, and focus on how they are being rearranged.\n\n5. Divide the problem into smaller parts by focusing on one element at a time, and track its changes throughout the sequence.\n\n6. Look for patterns or cycles in the sequence of events that can help simplify the problem.\n\n7. Analyze the problem from different perspectives, such as focusing on the initial and final states, and working backwards to find the solution.\n\n8. Consider the types of solutions that are typically produced for this type of problem, such as a specific arrangement or configuration.\n\n9. Make educated guesses about possible solutions based on the given information, and test them systematically.\n\n10. Generate a list of possible solutions, and systematically apply them to the problem to see if any progress can be made, using a process of elimination to narrow down the options.",
    "reasoning_structure": "Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:\n\n```\n{\n    \"Step 1: Initialize the State\": {\n        \"Create a table or diagram to represent the initial state of the objects or people\": {},\n        \"Fill in the initial state with the given information\": {}\n    },\n    \"Step 2: Track the Changes\": {\n        \"Go through each swap or trade in the sequence of events\": {},\n        \"Update the table or diagram to reflect the changes after each swap or trade\": {}\n    },\n    \"Step 3: Analyze the Final State\": {\n        \"After all swaps or trades have been made, analyze the final state of the objects or people\": {},\n        \"Identify the object or person that is being asked about in the question\": {}\n    },\n    \"Step 4: Determine the Answer\": {\n        \"Use the final state of the objects or people to determine the answer to the question\": {},\n        \"Choose the correct option from the given choices\": {}\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis reasoning plan can be applied to all the task examples provided, and can be used to solve similar tasks. It involves initializing the state, tracking the changes, analyzing the final state, and determining the answer.",
