    "selected_modules": "Based on the task examples, the following reasoning modules are crucial for solving tasks like them:\n\n1. Let's think step by step.\n2. Let's make a step by step plan and implement it with good notion and explanation.\n3. Try creative thinking, generate innovative and out-of-the-box ideas to solve the problem. \n4. What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed?\n5. How can I break down this problem into smaller, more manageable parts?\n6. What are the key assumptions underlying this problem?\n7. Critical Thinking: This style involves analyzing the problem from different perspectives, questioning assumptions, and evaluating the evidence or information available.\n8. Make a list of ideas for solving this problem, and apply them one by one to the problem to see if any progress can be made.",
    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. Let's break down the sequence of events step by step and track the changes that occur after each swap.\n\n2. Create a systematic plan to update the positions or possessions after each swap, using a diagram or table to visualize the changes.\n\n3. Think creatively about how to represent the swaps and the resulting changes, considering the use of diagrams, charts, or other visual aids to help track the updates.\n\n4. Identify the key elements that need to be tracked throughout the sequence of events, such as the positions or possessions of each individual.\n\n5. Divide the problem into smaller parts by focusing on one swap at a time, and analyze the effects of each swap on the overall situation.\n\n6. Recognize the assumptions that underlie the problem, such as the fact that each swap only involves two individuals, and consider how these assumptions might impact the solution.\n\n7. Apply critical thinking by analyzing the sequence of events from different perspectives, evaluating the evidence provided, and questioning any assumptions that may be implicit in the problem.\n\n8. Generate a list of possible approaches to solving the problem, such as using diagrams or tables to track the changes, and apply each approach systematically to see which one yields the correct solution.",
    "reasoning_structure": "Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:\n\n```\n{\n    Initialize the positions or possessions of each individual: {\n        Record the initial positions or possessions of each individual in a table or diagram:,\n    },\n    Iterate through each swap: {\n        Identify the two individuals involved in the swap:,\n        Update the positions or possessions of the two individuals in the table or diagram:,\n    },\n    Determine the final position or possession of the specified individual: {\n        Look up the final position or possession of the specified individual in the table or diagram:,\n    },\n    Match the final position or possession to the answer options: {\n        Compare the final position or possession to the answer options and select the correct answer:,\n    },\n}\n```\n\nThis reasoning plan can be applied to all the task examples provided, and it will guide the solver to arrive at the correct answer.",
