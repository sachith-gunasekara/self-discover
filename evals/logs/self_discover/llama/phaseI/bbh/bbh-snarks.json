It focuses on logical reasoning, evidence-based decision-making, and identifying potential biases or flaws in thinking.\n\n7. What are the alternative perspectives or viewpoints on this problem?\n\n10 is also selected, however since 10 and 1 are the same, 1 is chosen.\n\n11. Try creative thinking, generate innovative and out-of-the-box ideas to solve the problem. Explore unconventional solutions, thinking beyond traditional boundaries, and encouraging imagination and originality.\n\n16. What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed?\n\n25. Is the problem a technical or practical one that requires a specific expertise or skill set? Or is it more of a conceptual or theoretical problem?\n\n30. Is the problem a design challenge that requires creative solutions and innovation?\n\n35. Let's imagine the current best solution is totally wrong, what other ways are there to think about the problem specification?",
    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. Critical Thinking: Analyze the tone, language, and context of the statements to identify potential sarcasm, biases, or flaws in reasoning. Evaluate the evidence or information available and consider multiple perspectives to determine the most likely sarcastic statement.\n\n7. Alternative Perspectives: Consider the opposing viewpoints or interpretations of the statements, taking into account the context, tone, and language used. Identify potential ambiguities or contradictions that could indicate sarcasm.\n\n11. Creative Thinking: Think outside the box and consider unconventional explanations for the statements. Explore the possibility of irony, understatement, or exaggeration, and how these literary devices might be used to convey sarcasm.\n\n16. Core Issue: Identify the underlying issue or problem being addressed in the statements, and how sarcasm might be used to comment on or critique it. Determine the central theme or message being conveyed and how it relates to the potential sarcasm.\n\n25. Technical or Practical Problem: Recognize that identifying sarcasm is a nuanced task that requires a deep understanding of language, context, and cultural references. Consider the technical aspects of language, such as tone, syntax, and semantics, to inform your analysis.\n\n30. Design Challenge: View the task as a creative challenge that requires innovative thinking and problem-solving. Consider the design of the language, the structure of the statements, and the use of rhetorical devices to convey meaning and sarcasm.\n\n35. Alternative Solutions: Imagine alternative explanations for the statements, considering the possibility that the most obvious interpretation might be incorrect. Think about how the statements could be rephrased or reinterpreted to convey a different meaning, and how this might relate to the presence of sarcasm.",
