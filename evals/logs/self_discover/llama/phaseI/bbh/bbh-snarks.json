Critical Thinking: This style involves analyzing the problem from different perspectives, questioning assumptions, and evaluating the evidence or information available.\n2. What are the key assumptions underlying this problem?\n3. What are the alternative perspectives or viewpoints on this problem?\n4. Try creative thinking, generate innovative and out-of-the-box ideas to solve the problem.\n5. What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed?\n6. What are the underlying causes or factors contributing to the problem?\n7. Are there any potential solutions or strategies that have been tried before? If yes, what were the outcomes and lessons learned?\n10. Use Reflective Thinking: Step back from the problem, take the time for introspection and self-reflection.\n17. Let's think step by step.\n18. Let's make a step by step plan and implement it with good notion and explanation.\n30. Is the problem a design challenge that requires creative solutions and innovation?\n35. Let's imagine the current best solution is totally wrong, what other ways are there to think about the problem specification?",
    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. Critical Thinking: Analyze the tone, language, and context of the statements to identify potential sarcasm, questioning assumptions about the speaker's intent and evaluating the evidence or information available.\n\n2. What are the key assumptions underlying the tone and language used in the statements?\n\n3. What are the alternative perspectives or viewpoints on the issue being discussed, and how might they relate to sarcasm?\n\n4. Try creative thinking, generate innovative and out-of-the-box ideas to consider the potential for sarcasm, irony, or other forms of subtle meaning.\n\n5. What is the core issue or problem being addressed in the statements, and how might sarcasm be used to comment on it?\n\n6. What are the underlying causes or factors contributing to the tone and language used in the statements?\n\n7. Are there any common linguistic or rhetorical devices associated with sarcasm that are present in the statements?\n\n10. Use Reflective Thinking: Step back from the statements, take the time for introspection and self-reflection on your own biases and assumptions about the speaker's intent.\n\n17. Let's break down the statements into their constituent parts, analyzing each word and phrase for potential indicators of sarcasm.\n\n18. Let's make a systematic plan to evaluate the statements, considering the context, tone, and language used.\n\n30. Is the use of sarcasm a deliberate design choice, intended to convey a particular meaning or attitude?\n\n35. Let's imagine the statement is meant to be taken literally, what other ways are there to interpret the language and tone used?",
