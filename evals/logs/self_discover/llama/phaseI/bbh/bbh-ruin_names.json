    "selected_modules": "Based on the task examples provided, the following reasoning modules are crucial for solving tasks like them:\n\n1. Try creative thinking, generate innovative and out-of-the-box ideas to solve the problem. Explore unconventional solutions, thinking beyond traditional boundaries, and encouraging imagination and originality. (11)\n2. Critical Thinking: This style involves analyzing the problem from different perspectives, questioning assumptions, and evaluating the evidence or information available. It focuses on logical reasoning, evidence-based decision-making, and identifying potential biases or flaws in thinking. (10)\n3. What are the key assumptions underlying this problem? (5)\n4. What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed? (16)\n5. Are there any potential solutions or strategies that have been tried before? If yes, what were the outcomes and lessons learned? (18)\n6. Let's think step by step. (38)\n7. What kinds of solution typically are produced for this kind of problem specification? (33)\n8. Given the problem specification and the current best solution, have a guess about other possible solutions. (34)",
    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. Think creatively about wordplay, puns, and clever turns of phrase that could be used to humorously edit a title or name, considering homophones, homographs, and other linguistic tricks.\n\n2. Analyze the original title or name from different perspectives, breaking it down into its component parts, and evaluating how each part could be modified or manipulated to create a humorous effect.\n\n3. Identify the key assumptions underlying what makes a humorous edit, such as the use of clever language, unexpected twists, or playful references.\n\n4. Determine the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed in creating a humorous edit, such as finding a balance between cleverness and clarity, or avoiding offensiveness.\n\n5. Consider previous examples of humorous edits and what made them successful, as well as any common pitfalls or clich\u00e9s to avoid.\n\n6. Break down the process of creating a humorous edit into step-by-step components, such as identifying potential wordplay, experimenting with different variations, and refining the edit for maximum impact.\n\n7. Think about the types of humorous edits that are typically made for different types of titles or names, such as movies, artists, or books, and how these conventions could be used or subverted.\n\n8. Given the original title or name and any existing humorous edits, brainstorm other possible edits that could be made, considering a range of approaches and styles.",
