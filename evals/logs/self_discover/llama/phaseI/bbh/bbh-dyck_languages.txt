Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    "Analyze the input sequence": {
        "Identify the opening brackets in the sequence": [],
        "Identify the closing brackets in the sequence": []
    },
    "Create a stack to track the opening brackets": {
        "Push each opening bracket onto the stack": []
    },
    "Match opening and closing brackets": {
        "For each closing bracket in the sequence": [
            "Check if the top of the stack contains the corresponding opening bracket": [],
            "If it does, pop the opening bracket from the stack": [],
            "If it doesn't, identify the mismatched or missing bracket": []
        ]
    },
    "Complete the sequence": {
        "While the stack is not empty": [
            "Pop the top opening bracket from the stack": [],
            "Add the corresponding closing bracket to the sequence": []
        ]
    },
    "Verify the completed sequence": {
        "Check if all brackets are properly matched and closed": []
    }
}
```
