Critical Thinking: This style involves analyzing the problem from different perspectives, questioning assumptions, and evaluating the evidence or information available.\n4. How can I simplify the problem so that it is easier to solve?\n9. How can I break down this problem into smaller, more manageable parts?\n16. What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed?\n17. What are the underlying causes or factors contributing to the problem?\n20. Are there any relevant data or information that can provide insights into the problem?\n25. Is the problem a technical or practical one that requires a specific expertise or skill set?\n38. Let's think step by step.\n39. Let's make a step by step plan and implement it with good notion and explanation.",
    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. Critical Thinking: Analyze the given information, identify the relationships between objects, and evaluate the logical consistency of the statements to determine the correct order or arrangement.\n\n4. Simplification: Identify the key elements and relationships in the problem, and simplify the information by eliminating unnecessary details or combining similar statements.\n\n9. Problem Decomposition: Break down the problem into smaller parts, such as individual statements or relationships, and analyze each part separately to understand the overall arrangement.\n\n16. Core Issue Identification: Identify the central question or problem being asked, such as determining the correct order or arrangement of objects, and focus on resolving that issue.\n\n17. Causal Analysis: Identify the underlying causes or relationships between objects, such as \"A is to the left of B\" or \"A is more expensive than B\", and use those relationships to determine the correct arrangement.\n\n20. Data Analysis: Examine the given information, identify patterns or relationships, and use that data to inform decisions about the correct arrangement or order.\n\n25. Expertise Identification: Recognize that these types of problems require logical reasoning and analytical skills, rather than specific technical expertise, and approach the problem with a logical and methodical mindset.\n\n38. Step-by-Step Thinking: Approach the problem in a systematic and sequential manner, analyzing each statement or relationship individually and using that information to build a complete understanding of the arrangement.\n\n39. Step-by-Step Planning: Develop a plan to solve the problem, breaking it down into individual steps such as:\n- Analyzing each statement or relationship\n- Identifying key elements and relationships\n- Simplifying the information\n- Combining the information to determine the correct arrangement\n- Verifying the solution through logical consistency checks.",
