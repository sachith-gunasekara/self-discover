    "selected_modules": "Based on the task examples, the following reasoning modules are crucial for solving tasks like them:\n\n1. Try creative thinking, generate innovative and out-of-the-box ideas to solve the problem. Explore unconventional solutions, thinking beyond traditional boundaries, and encouraging imagination and originality.\n4. How can I simplify the problem so that it is easier to solve?\n9. How can I break down this problem into smaller, more manageable parts?\n10. Critical Thinking: This style involves analyzing the problem from different perspectives, questioning assumptions, and evaluating the evidence or information available. It focuses on logical reasoning, evidence-based decision-making, and identifying potential biases or flaws in thinking.\n13. Use systems thinking: Consider the problem as part of a larger system and understanding the interconnectedness of various elements. Focuses on identifying the underlying causes, feedback loops, and interdependencies that influence the problem, and developing holistic solutions that address the system as a whole.\n38. Let's think step by step.\n39. Let's make a step by step plan and implement it with good notion and explanation.",
    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. Creative Bracketing: Generate innovative and out-of-the-box ideas to balance and close parentheses, exploring unconventional patterns and encouraging imagination and originality in sequence completion.\n\n4. Simplify the Sequence: Identify the simplest way to balance and close the parentheses by eliminating unnecessary elements and focusing on the essential structure of the sequence.\n\n9. Break Down the Brackets: Divide the sequence into smaller, more manageable parts, isolating individual parentheses and brackets to ensure proper closure and balance.\n\n10. Critical Sequence Analysis: Analyze the sequence from different perspectives, questioning assumptions about the order and structure of the parentheses, and evaluating the evidence or information available to ensure accurate completion.\n\n13. Systems Thinking for Sequences: Consider the sequence as part of a larger system of nested parentheses and brackets, understanding the interconnectedness of various elements and identifying the underlying patterns and structures that influence the sequence.\n\n38. Step-by-Step Bracketing: Approach the sequence completion task in a systematic and methodical way, closing parentheses and brackets one step at a time, and ensuring accuracy and balance at each stage.\n\n39. Sequential Plan Implementation: Develop a step-by-step plan to complete the sequence, breaking down the task into manageable parts, and implementing the plan with attention to detail and a clear understanding of the sequence structure.",
