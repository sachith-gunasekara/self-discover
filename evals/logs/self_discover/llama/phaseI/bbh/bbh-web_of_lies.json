Critical Thinking: This style involves analyzing the problem from different perspectives, questioning assumptions, and evaluating the evidence or information available.\n4. How can I simplify the problem so that it is easier to solve?\n9. How can I break down this problem into smaller, more manageable parts?\n10 is a duplicate of 1, so not selected.\n16. What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed?\n17. What are the underlying causes or factors contributing to the problem?\n34. Given the problem specification and the current best solution, have a guess about other possible solutions.\n38. Let's think step by step.\n39. Let's make a step by step plan and implement it with good notion and explanation.",
    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. Critical Thinking: Analyze the statements from different perspectives, question the truthfulness of each person, and evaluate the chain of statements to identify patterns or inconsistencies.\n\n4. Simplification: Identify the key statements and relationships between people to simplify the problem, and focus on the most relevant information to determine the truthfulness of the target person.\n\n9. Problem Decomposition: Break down the chain of statements into smaller parts, analyzing the relationships between each pair of people to identify potential lies or truths, and then combine the results to determine the overall truthfulness.\n\n16. Core Issue Identification: Identify the central question of whether the target person tells the truth or lies, and focus on the statements that directly relate to this issue.\n\n17. Causal Analysis: Analyze the relationships between each person's statements to identify potential causes or motivations for lying or telling the truth, and consider how these factors might influence the target person's statement.\n\n34. Alternative Solution Generation: Consider alternative scenarios or possibilities for the chain of statements, including potential lies or truths, and evaluate the likelihood of each scenario to determine the most plausible solution.\n\n38. Step-by-Step Analysis: Analyze the chain of statements step by step, evaluating the truthfulness of each person's statement based on the previous statements, and iteratively refining the analysis to determine the target person's truthfulness.\n\n39. Systematic Planning: Develop a systematic plan to analyze the chain of statements, including identifying key relationships, evaluating potential lies or truths, and combining the results to determine the target person's truthfulness, and execute the plan with clear explanations and justifications.",

A more detailed structure can be created as follows:\n\n```\n{\n    \"Step 1: Initialize the Truthfulness of Each Person\": {\n        \"Assign a truthfulness value (true or false) to each person based on the given statements\": {}\n    },\n    \"Step 2: Analyze the Chain of Statements\": {\n        \"For each person, analyze the statements made by others about them\": {},\n        \"Update the truthfulness value of each person based on the analysis\": {}\n    },\n    \"Step 3: Resolve Conflicts and Inconsistencies\": {\n        \"Identify conflicts or inconsistencies in the truthfulness values assigned to each person\": {},\n        \"Resolve the conflicts by re-evaluating the statements and updating the truthfulness values\": {}\n    },\n    \"Step 4: Determine the Truthfulness of the Target Person\": {\n        \"Based on the final truthfulness values assigned to each person, determine the truthfulness of the target person\": {}\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis structure can be applied to the given task examples by iteratively analyzing the statements and updating the truthfulness values of each person until a consistent solution is reached.",
