How can I simplify the problem so that it is easier to solve?\n9. How can I break down this problem into smaller, more manageable parts?\n16. What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed?\n20. Are there any relevant data or information that can provide insights into the problem?\n25. Is the problem a technical or practical one that requires a specific expertise or skill set?\n38. Let's think step by step.\n39. Let's make a step by step plan and implement it with good notion and explanation.",
    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. Critical Thinking: Analyze the problem by identifying key information, such as dates, events, and timeframes, and evaluate how they relate to each other.\n\n4. Simplification: Identify the most relevant information and eliminate unnecessary details to focus on the core issue, such as calculating a specific date or timeframe.\n\n9. Problem Decomposition: Break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts, such as identifying the starting date, calculating the elapsed time, and determining the resulting date.\n\n16. Core Issue Identification: Determine the central question or problem, such as finding a specific date or timeframe, and focus on resolving that issue.\n\n20. Data Analysis: Identify relevant data, such as dates, timeframes, and events, and analyze how they relate to each other to gain insights into the problem.\n\n25. Expertise Identification: Recognize that tasks like these require basic math and calendar-based calculations, and apply those skills to solve the problem.\n\n38. Step-by-Step Thinking: Approach the problem in a logical, sequential manner, such as calculating the elapsed time, determining the resulting date, and verifying the answer.\n\n39. Step-by-Step Planning: Develop a systematic plan to solve the problem, including identifying key information, calculating the elapsed time, and determining the resulting date, and execute that plan to arrive at a solution.",
