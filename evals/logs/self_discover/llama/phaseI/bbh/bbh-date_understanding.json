    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. How could I devise a step-by-step calendar calculation to help solve the date problem?\n\n4. How can I simplify the date problem by identifying the key elements, such as the initial date, time passed, and required date format?\n\n9. How can I break down the date problem into smaller parts, such as calculating the number of days in each month, considering leap years, and determining the day of the week?\n\n10. Critical Thinking: This style involves analyzing the date problem from different perspectives, questioning assumptions about the calendar system, and evaluating the given information to determine the correct date.\n\n13. Use calendar systems thinking: Consider the date problem as part of a larger calendar system and understand the interconnectedness of various elements, such as months, years, and days of the week.\n\n16. What is the core date problem that needs to be addressed, such as finding the date today, yesterday, or tomorrow?\n\n25. Is the date problem a technical or practical one that requires specific knowledge of calendar systems, date formats, or time calculations?\n\n38. Let's think step by step about the calendar calculation, considering each day, month, and year.\n\n39. Let's make a step-by-step plan to calculate the date, using a logical and systematic approach to arrive at the correct answer.",
