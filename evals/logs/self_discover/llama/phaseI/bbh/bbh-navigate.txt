Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    Initialize starting position: {
        Set x-coordinate to 0,
        Set y-coordinate to 0,
        Set direction to "forward" or "north"
    },
    Iterate through each instruction: {
        Determine the type of instruction: {
            If "take" or "move", then: {
                Determine the direction of movement: {
                    If "forward" or "backward", then: {
                        Update y-coordinate accordingly
                    },
                    If "left" or "right", then: {
                        Update x-coordinate accordingly
                    }
                }
            },
            If "turn", then: {
                Update direction accordingly
            },
            If "turn around", then: {
                Update direction to the opposite direction
            }
        }
    },
    Determine if the final position is the same as the starting position: {
        Check if x-coordinate is 0 and y-coordinate is 0
    },
    Return the answer: {
        If final position is the same as the starting position, then: "Yes",
        Otherwise: "No"
    }
}
