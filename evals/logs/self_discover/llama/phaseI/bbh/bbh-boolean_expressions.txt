Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    "Step 1: Analyze the logical expression": {
        "Identify the logical operators and operands in the expression": {},
        "Determine the order of operations based on the logical operators": {}
    },
    "Step 2: Simplify the logical expression": {
        "Remove any unnecessary operators or parentheses": {},
        "Combine like terms and simplify the expression": {}
    },
    "Step 3: Evaluate the logical expression step by step": {
        "Start with the innermost parentheses or operators": {},
        "Evaluate each operator and operand in sequence": {},
        "Apply the logical rules and operators to produce the final result": {}
    },
    "Step 4: Apply the logical rules and operators": {
        "Apply the NOT operator to any operands": {},
        "Apply the AND operator to any operands": {},
        "Apply the OR operator to any operands": {}
    },
    "Step 5: Determine the final result": {
        "Based on the evaluation of the logical expression, determine the final result": {}
    }
}
