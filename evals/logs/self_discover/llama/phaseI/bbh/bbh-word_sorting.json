    "selected_modules": "Based on the task examples, the following reasoning modules are crucial for solving tasks like them:\n\n1. What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed?\n4. How can I simplify the problem so that it is easier to solve?\n9. How can I break down this problem into smaller, more manageable parts?\n38. Let's think step by step.\n39. Let's make a step by step plan and implement it with good notion and explanation.\n\nThese modules can help in solving tasks that involve sorting and organizing information in a systematic and methodical way.",
    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. What are the key elements that need to be organized or sorted in this task, and what is the primary goal or objective?\n\n4. How can I simplify the list of words by identifying common characteristics, such as prefixes or suffixes, to make them easier to sort?\n\n9. How can I break down the list of words into smaller groups or categories, such as words starting with the same letter or having similar meanings, to make them more manageable?\n\n38. Let's go through the list of words step by step, comparing each word to the ones that come before and after it, to ensure that they are in the correct order.\n\n39. Let's create a step-by-step plan for sorting the list of words, including checking for correct spelling, identifying words that start with the same letter, and verifying the alphabetical order of each word, and then implement it with attention to detail and clear explanation.",
