How can I simplify the problem so that it is easier to solve?\n9. How can I break down this problem into smaller, more manageable parts?\n16. What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed?\n17. What are the underlying causes or factors contributing to the problem?\n20. Are there any relevant data or information that can provide insights into the problem? \n25. Is the problem a technical or practical one that requires a specific expertise or skill set? \n38. Let's think step by step.\n39. Let's make a step by step plan and implement it with good notion and explanation.",
    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. Critical Thinking: Analyze the given statements from different perspectives, identify the relationships between the objects, and evaluate the logical consistency of the information to determine the correct order or position of the objects.\n\n4. Simplification: Identify the most critical statements that determine the order or position of the objects and focus on those to simplify the problem, eliminating irrelevant information.\n\n9. Decomposition: Break down the problem into smaller parts by analyzing each statement separately, identifying the relationships between the objects, and combining the information to determine the correct order or position of the objects.\n\n16. Core Issue Identification: Identify the key question being asked (e.g., which object is in a specific position) and focus on the relevant statements that provide information about that position.\n\n17. Causal Analysis: Identify the cause-and-effect relationships between the statements, such as \"A is to the left of B\" implies \"B is to the right of A\", to determine the correct order or position of the objects.\n\n20. Data Analysis: Analyze the given statements as data points, identifying patterns, relationships, and inconsistencies to determine the correct order or position of the objects.\n\n25. Expertise Identification: Recognize that these problems require logical reasoning and spatial reasoning skills, rather than specific domain expertise.\n\n38. Step-by-Step Thinking: Think step-by-step, analyzing each statement in sequence, and combining the information to determine the correct order or position of the objects.\n\n39. Step-by-Step Planning: Create a plan to solve the problem by breaking it down into smaller steps, analyzing each statement, and combining the information to determine the correct order or position of the objects.",
