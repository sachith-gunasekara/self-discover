    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. Critical Thinking: Analyze the sentence structure and word order from different linguistic perspectives, questioning assumptions about the standard adjective order and evaluating the grammatical evidence or information available.\n\n4. Simplification: How can I break down the sentence into its individual components, such as adjectives and nouns, to make it easier to determine the correct order?\n\n10. Assumption Identification: What are the key assumptions underlying the standard adjective order in English, and how do they apply to the given sentence options?\n\n20. Data Analysis: Are there any relevant linguistic data or information, such as grammar rules or style guides, that can provide insights into the correct adjective order?\n\n25. Expertise: Is the problem a linguistic or grammatical one that requires a specific expertise or skill set, such as knowledge of English grammar or style guides?\n\n30. Creative Solution: Is the problem a linguistic design challenge that requires creative solutions and innovation, such as considering alternative sentence structures or word orders?\n\n38. Step-by-Step Analysis: Let's analyze the sentence options step by step, considering the individual adjectives and their relationships to each other and the noun, to determine the correct order.",
