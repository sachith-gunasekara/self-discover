Let's make a step by step plan and implement it with good notion and explanation.\n3. Try creative thinking, generate innovative and out-of-the-box ideas to solve the problem.\n4. What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed?\n5. How can I break down this problem into smaller, more manageable parts?\n6. What are the underlying causes or factors contributing to the problem?\n9. Given the problem specification and the current best solution, have a guess about other possible solutions.\n38. Let's think step by step.\n39. Let's make a step by step plan and implement it with good notion and explanation.",
    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. Break down the sequence of events step by step to track the changes and updates.\n\n2. Create a systematic plan to follow the sequence of swaps or trades, and use a notation system to keep track of the updates.\n\n3. Think creatively about how to visualize and represent the swaps or trades, such as using diagrams or charts to help understand the sequence of events.\n\n4. Identify the key elements that are being swapped or traded, and focus on how they are being rearranged.\n\n5. Divide the problem into smaller parts by analyzing each swap or trade individually, and then combine the results to understand the final outcome.\n\n6. Look for patterns or underlying structures that can help explain how the swaps or trades are affecting the arrangement of the elements.\n\n9. Consider alternative scenarios or possibilities for how the swaps or trades could have occurred, and use this to inform your understanding of the actual sequence of events.\n\n38. Analyze the sequence of events step by step, using a systematic approach to track the changes and updates.\n\n39. Develop a clear plan to follow the sequence of swaps or trades, using a notation system or visualization technique to help understand the sequence of events.",
