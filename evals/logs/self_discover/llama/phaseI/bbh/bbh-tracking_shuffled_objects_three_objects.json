    "selected_modules": "Based on the task examples, the following reasoning modules are crucial for solving tasks like them:\n\n1. Let's think step by step.\n2. Let's make a step by step plan and implement it with good notion and explanation.\n3. How can I break down this problem into smaller, more manageable parts?\n4. What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed?\n5. Try creative thinking, generate innovative and out-of-the-box ideas to solve the problem.\n6. What are the key assumptions underlying this problem?\n7. What are the underlying causes or factors contributing to the problem?\n8. Are there any potential solutions or strategies that have been tried before? If yes, what were the outcomes and lessons learned?\n9. Critical Thinking: This style involves analyzing the problem from different perspectives, questioning assumptions, and evaluating the evidence or information available.\n10. Use Reflective Thinking: Step back from the problem, take the time for introspection and self-reflection.",
    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. Let's break down the sequence of events step by step to understand the changes that occur at each stage.\n\n2. Create a systematic plan to track the exchanges or swaps between individuals, ensuring that each step is clearly documented and its impact analyzed.\n\n3. Divide the problem into smaller parts by focusing on one exchange or swap at a time, analyzing its effects before moving on to the next one.\n\n4. Identify the key elements that need to be tracked throughout the sequence of events, such as the initial positions or possessions of each individual.\n\n5. Consider unconventional ways to represent the sequence of events, such as using diagrams or charts to visualize the exchanges or swaps.\n\n6. What assumptions can be made about the nature of the exchanges or swaps, such as whether they are reciprocal or irreversible?\n\n7. Analyze the causal relationships between each exchange or swap, examining how they impact the final outcome.\n\n8. Have similar problems or scenarios been encountered before, and if so, what strategies were employed to solve them?\n\n9. Critically evaluate the information provided, questioning any assumptions or ambiguities that may arise during the analysis.\n\n10. Reflect on the problem-solving process, considering whether alternative approaches or strategies could have been employed to achieve the solution more efficiently.",
