    "Step 1: Critical Thinking": {
        "Identify key information": {
            "Extract dates, events, and timeframes from the problem statement"
        },
        "Evaluate relationships": {
            "Determine how the extracted information relates to each other"
        }
    },
    "Step 2: Simplification": {
        "Eliminate unnecessary details": {
            "Focus on the core issue by removing irrelevant information"
        }
    },
    "Step 3: Problem Decomposition": {
        "Break down the problem": {
            "Identify the starting date, calculate the elapsed time, and determine the resulting date"
        }
    },
    "Step 4: Core Issue Identification": {
        "Determine the central question": {
            "Identify the key question or problem to be solved"

        "Apply relevant skills": {
            "Utilize basic math and calendar-based calculations to solve the problem"
        }
    },
    "Step 7: Date Calculation": {
        "Calculate the resulting date": {
            "Add or subtract the elapsed time from the starting date"
        }
    },
    "Step 8: Date Formatting": {
        "Format the resulting date": {
            "Express the resulting date in the required format (MM/DD/YYYY)"
        }
    },
    "Step 9: Verification": {
        "Verify the answer": {
            "Check the resulting date for accuracy and consistency"
