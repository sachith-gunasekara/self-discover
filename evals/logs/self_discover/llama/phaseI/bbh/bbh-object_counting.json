What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed?\n4. How can I simplify the problem so that it is easier to solve?\n9. How can I break down this problem into smaller, more manageable parts?\n16. What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed?\n25. Is the problem a technical or practical one that requires a specific expertise or skill set? Or is it more of a conceptual or theoretical problem?\n38. Let's think step by step.\n39. Let's make a step by step plan and implement it with good notion and explanation.\n\nAdditionally, the following modules can also be helpful:\n\n10. Critical Thinking: This style involves analyzing the problem from different perspectives, questioning assumptions, and evaluating the evidence or information available.\n30. Is the problem a design challenge that requires creative solutions and innovation?",
    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. What are the key elements or items that need to be identified, classified, or counted in this problem?\n\n4. Can I simplify the problem by focusing on a specific category or type of item, and ignoring irrelevant information?\n\n9. How can I break down the list of items into smaller groups or categories to make it easier to count or classify them?\n\n16. What is the specific question being asked, and what type of items or elements are relevant to answering it?\n\n25. Is the problem a straightforward counting or classification task, or does it require some domain-specific knowledge or expertise (e.g. knowledge of music or food)?\n\n38. Let's go through the list of items step by step and identify which ones fit the relevant category or criteria.\n\n39. Let's make a plan to systematically count or classify the items, and then implement it to ensure accuracy.\n\nAdditionally, the following modules can also be helpful:\n\n10. Critical Thinking: This style involves carefully examining the list of items, questioning assumptions about what should be included or excluded, and evaluating the relevance of each item to the question being asked.\n\n30. Is the problem a creative challenge that requires thinking outside the box, or is it a more straightforward task that can be solved through systematic counting or classification?",
