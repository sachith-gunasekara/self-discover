Is the problem a design challenge that requires creative solutions and innovation?\n38. Let's think step by step.\n39. Let's make a step by step plan and implement it with good notion and explanation.\n\nAdditionally, the following modules can also be helpful:\n\n10. Critical Thinking: This style involves analyzing the problem from different perspectives, questioning assumptions, and evaluating the evidence or information available.\n13. Use systems thinking: Consider the problem as part of a larger system and understanding the interconnectedness of various elements.\n15. Use Reflective Thinking: Step back from the problem, take the time for introspection and self-reflection.",
    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. What are the key elements or items that need to be identified, classified, or counted in this problem?\n\n4. How can I categorize or group the items in this problem to simplify the task and make it easier to solve?\n\n9. How can I break down the items in this problem into smaller, more manageable categories or groups to facilitate counting or identification?\n\n10. Critical Thinking: Analyze the problem from different perspectives, questioning assumptions about the classification or identification of items, and evaluate the evidence or information available.\n\n13. Use systems thinking: Consider the items in this problem as part of a larger system or category, and understand the interconnectedness of various elements or subcategories.\n\n15. Use Reflective Thinking: Step back from the problem, take the time for introspection and self-reflection to ensure that all items are correctly identified, classified, or counted.\n\n16. What is the core question or problem that needs to be addressed, such as identifying, classifying, or counting specific items?\n\n25. Is the problem a straightforward counting or identification task, or does it require specific knowledge or expertise about the items or categories involved?\n\n30. Is the problem a creative challenge that requires innovative solutions, such as finding new ways to categorize or group items?\n\n38. Let's think step by step, identifying and counting each item or group of items systematically.\n\n39. Let's make a step-by-step plan and implement it with a clear and logical approach to identifying, classifying, or counting the items in this problem.\n\nNote that these adaptations focus on the key aspects of the tasks, such as identifying, classifying, and counting items, and aim to provide a more structured and systematic approach to solving these types of problems.",
