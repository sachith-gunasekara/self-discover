How can I simplify the problem so that it is easier to solve?\n5. What are the key assumptions underlying this problem?\n10. Critical Thinking: This style involves analyzing the problem from different perspectives, questioning assumptions, and evaluating the evidence or information available.\n16. What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed?\n25. Is the problem a technical or practical one that requires a specific expertise or skill set? Or is it more of a conceptual or theoretical problem?\n30. Is the problem a design challenge that requires creative solutions and innovation?\n34. Given the problem specification and the current best solution, have a guess about other possible solutions.\n35. Let's imagine the current best solution is totally wrong, what other ways are there to think about the problem specification?\n38. Let's think step by step.",
    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. Critical Thinking: Analyze the argument from different perspectives, questioning assumptions, and evaluating the evidence or information available. Identify the premises and conclusion, and assess the logical connections between them.\n\n4. Simplification: Break down complex arguments into simpler, more manageable components. Identify the key elements, such as premises, conclusions, and logical operators, and rephrase them in a clearer and more concise manner.\n\n5. Assumption Identification: Identify the underlying assumptions in the argument, including implicit premises, definitions, and presuppositions. Evaluate the validity and relevance of these assumptions.\n\n10. Critical Thinking: Evaluate the argument's logical structure, identifying potential fallacies, biases, and errors in reasoning. Consider alternative perspectives and counterarguments.\n\n16. Core Issue Identification: Identify the central claim or problem being addressed in the argument. Determine the key issue or question being debated.\n\n25. Expertise Evaluation: Assess whether the argument requires specialized knowledge or expertise to evaluate. Consider whether the argument relies on technical or practical information that requires specific skills or training.\n\n30. Creative Solution Generation: Consider alternative perspectives and potential counterarguments. Generate novel solutions or approaches to the problem, and evaluate their feasibility and validity.\n\n34. Alternative Solution Exploration: Explore alternative explanations, theories, or solutions that could account for the data or phenomenon in question. Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of these alternatives.\n\n35. Contrarian Thinking: Assume the opposite of the conclusion or a key premise, and evaluate the implications of this assumption. Consider whether this opposing view is plausible or supported by evidence.\n\n38. Step-by-Step Analysis: Break down the argument into its constituent parts, and evaluate each step in the reasoning process. Identify potential errors, fallacies, or weaknesses in the argument.",
