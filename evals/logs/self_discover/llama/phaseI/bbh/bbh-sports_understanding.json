    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. What are the key assumptions underlying the context of the sentence, such as the sport being referred to and the specific action being described?\n\n4. How can I simplify the sentence by identifying the key elements, such as the person, action, and sport, to make it easier to evaluate its plausibility?\n\n10. Critical Thinking: Analyze the sentence from different perspectives, such as the rules of the sport, the abilities of the person mentioned, and the context in which the action is taking place, to evaluate its plausibility.\n\n16. What is the core issue or problem with the sentence that needs to be addressed, such as an inconsistency with the sport or action being described?\n\n20. Are there any relevant data or information, such as sports statistics or rules, that can provide insights into the plausibility of the sentence? If yes, what data sources are available, and how can they be analyzed?\n\n25. Is the problem with the sentence a technical or practical one that requires specific knowledge of the sport or action being described? Or is it more of a conceptual or theoretical problem with the sentence itself?\n\n30. Is the sentence a description of a creative or innovative action in a sport, or is it a more standard or common action?\n\n34. Given the sentence and the current understanding of the sport or action being described, have a guess about other possible explanations or interpretations of the sentence.\n\n35. Let's imagine the sentence is totally wrong or misleading, what other ways are there to think about the sentence and its context to evaluate its plausibility?",
