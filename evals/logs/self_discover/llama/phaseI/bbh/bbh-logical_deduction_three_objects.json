Critical Thinking: This style involves analyzing the problem from different perspectives, questioning assumptions, and evaluating the evidence or information available.\n4. How can I simplify the problem so that it is easier to solve?\n9. How can I break down this problem into smaller, more manageable parts?\n16. What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed?\n17. What are the underlying causes or factors contributing to the problem?\n20. Are there any relevant data or information that can provide insights into the problem?\n25. Is the problem a technical or practical one that requires a specific expertise or skill set?\n38. Let's think step by step.\n39. Let's make a step by step plan and implement it with good notion and explanation.",
    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. Critical Thinking: Analyze the given statements from different perspectives, identify the relationships between the objects, and evaluate the logical consistency of the information.\n\n4. Simplification: Identify the key elements of the problem and eliminate any irrelevant information to simplify the decision-making process.\n\n9. Problem Decomposition: Break down the problem into smaller parts by identifying the individual objects and their relationships, and analyze each part separately to understand the overall arrangement.\n\n16. Core Issue Identification: Identify the central question being asked, such as determining the order or position of the objects, and focus on resolving that issue.\n\n17. Causal Analysis: Identify the underlying causes or factors that contribute to the arrangement of the objects, such as the relationships between the objects or the given conditions.\n\n20. Data Analysis: Examine the given information and identify any relevant patterns, relationships, or clues that can provide insights into the problem.\n\n25. Expertise Identification: Recognize that the problem requires logical reasoning and analytical skills, rather than specific technical expertise.\n\n38. Step-by-Step Analysis: Analyze the problem step by step, using a systematic approach to evaluate the given information and arrive at a conclusion.\n\n39. Step-by-Step Planning: Develop a plan to solve the problem by breaking it down into smaller steps, analyzing each step separately, and combining the results to arrive at a conclusion.",
