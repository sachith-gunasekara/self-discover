Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    "Analyze the tone and language of the statements": {
        "Identify potential sarcasm indicators such as irony, understatement, or exaggeration": {},
        "Consider the context in which the statements are made": {}
    },
    "Evaluate the evidence or information available": {
        "Consider multiple perspectives to determine the most likely sarcastic statement": {},
        "Look for potential ambiguities or contradictions that could indicate sarcasm": {}
    },
    "Identify the underlying issue or problem being addressed": {
        "Determine the central theme or message being conveyed and how it relates to the potential sarcasm": {}
    },
    "Consider alternative explanations for the statements": {
        "Think about how the statements could be rephrased or reinterpreted to convey a different meaning": {},
        "Consider the possibility that the most obvious interpretation might be incorrect": {}
    },
    "Compare the statements to determine which one is more likely to be sarcastic": {
        "Look for differences in tone, language, and context that could indicate sarcasm": {},
        "Consider the use of rhetorical devices such as irony, understatement, or exaggeration": {}
    },
    "Make a final determination of which statement is sarcastic": {
        "Based on the analysis, evaluation, and comparison of the statements": {}
    }
}
