Critical Thinking: This style involves analyzing the problem from different perspectives, questioning assumptions, and evaluating the evidence or information available.\n4. How can I simplify the problem so that it is easier to solve?\n9. How can I break down this problem into smaller, more manageable parts?\n16. What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed?\n20. Are there any relevant data or information that can provide insights into the problem? If yes, what data sources are available, and how can they be analyzed?\n38. Let's think step by step.\n39. Let's make a step by step plan and implement it with good notion and explanation.",
    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. Critical Thinking: Analyze the timeline of events, identify gaps, and evaluate the likelihood of the person visiting the location within a specific time frame.\n\n4. Simplifying the Problem: Identify the essential events and time frames that are relevant to the problem, and eliminate unnecessary information to narrow down the possible time range.\n\n9. Breaking Down the Problem: Divide the timeline into smaller segments, and analyze each segment separately to identify potential time slots for the person to visit the location.\n\n16. Identifying the Core Issue: Determine the specific time constraints and location restrictions that are relevant to the problem, and focus on finding a solution that satisfies these conditions.\n\n20. Using Relevant Data: Identify the key events and time frames that provide insights into the person's schedule, and use this information to infer the most likely time range for visiting the location.\n\n38. Step-by-Step Analysis: Analyze the timeline step by step, considering each event and time frame in sequence, to identify potential opportunities for the person to visit the location.\n\n39. Creating a Step-by-Step Plan: Develop a systematic plan to evaluate the timeline, identify gaps, and determine the most likely time range for the person to visit the location, using a logical and sequential approach.",
