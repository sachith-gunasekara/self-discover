    "selected_modules": "Based on the task examples, the following reasoning modules are crucial for solving tasks like them:\n\n1. Critical Thinking: This style involves analyzing the problem from different perspectives, questioning assumptions, and evaluating the evidence or information available.\n4. How can I simplify the problem so that it is easier to solve?\n9. How can I break down this problem into smaller, more manageable parts?\n16. What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed?\n17. What are the underlying causes or factors contributing to the problem?\n20. Are there any relevant data or information that can provide insights into the problem?\n25. Is the problem a technical or practical one that requires a specific expertise or skill set?\n38. Let's think step by step.\n39. Let's make a step by step plan and implement it with good notion and explanation.",
    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. Critical Thinking: Analyze the given information, identify the time slots when the person is occupied, and find the available time slots when they could have gone to the specified location.\n\n4. Simplifying the Problem: Identify the essential information, such as the person's wake-up time, occupied time slots, and the closing time of the location, to narrow down the possible time range.\n\n9. Breaking Down the Problem: Divide the day into smaller time slots based on the given information and analyze each slot to determine when the person could have gone to the location.\n\n16. Identifying the Core Issue: Recognize that the core issue is to find a time slot when the person is not occupied and the location is open.\n\n17. Identifying Underlying Causes: Consider the factors that restrict the person's availability, such as their wake-up time, occupied time slots, and the closing time of the location.\n\n20. Using Relevant Data: Utilize the given information about the person's activities and the location's closing time to make an informed decision.\n\n25. Technical or Practical Expertise: Recognize that no specific expertise is required, but rather logical reasoning and time management skills.\n\n38. Step-by-Step Thinking: Systematically analyze each time slot, considering the person's availability and the location's opening hours, to determine the possible time range.\n\n39. Step-by-Step Planning: Create a mental or visual timeline of the person's activities and the location's opening hours to identify the available time slots.",
