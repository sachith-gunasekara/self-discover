Let's make a step by step plan and implement it with good notion and explanation.\n3. How can I break down this problem into smaller, more manageable parts?\n4. What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed?\n5. Try creative thinking, generate innovative and out-of-the-box ideas to solve the problem.\n6. Critical Thinking: This style involves analyzing the problem from different perspectives, questioning assumptions, and evaluating the evidence or information available.\n9. What are the key assumptions underlying this problem?\n38. Let's think step by step.\n39. Let's make a step by step plan and implement it with good notion and explanation.",
    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. Break down the sequence of events step by step to track changes and updates.\n\n2. Create a systematic plan to follow the sequence of swaps or trades, and use a notation system to keep track of the updates.\n\n3. Divide the problem into smaller parts by focusing on one person or item at a time, and analyze how they are affected by each swap or trade.\n\n4. Identify the key elements that need to be tracked, such as the initial positions or possessions, and the changes that occur after each swap or trade.\n\n5. Think creatively about how to represent the swaps or trades, such as using diagrams or charts, to help visualize the changes.\n\n6. Critically evaluate the sequence of events by checking for any patterns or inconsistencies, and consider alternative perspectives to ensure accuracy.\n\n9. Identify any assumptions that are being made, such as assuming that each swap or trade is a one-to-one exchange, and consider how these assumptions might affect the outcome.\n\n38. Analyze the sequence of events step by step, using a systematic approach to track changes and updates.\n\n39. Develop a clear plan to follow the sequence of swaps or trades, using a notation system to keep track of the updates and ensure accuracy.",
