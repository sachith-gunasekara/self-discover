Here is the operationalized reasoning plan in JSON format:

```
{
    "Determine the context of the sentence": {
        "Identify the key elements of the sentence (e.g. person, action, event, location)": {},
        "Determine the sport or domain being referred to": {}
    },
    "Assess the plausibility of the sentence": {
        "Check if the person mentioned is a known participant in the sport or domain": {},
        "Check if the action mentioned is a common or possible action in the sport or domain": {},
        "Check if the event or location mentioned is relevant to the sport or domain": {}
    },
    "Analyze the sentence from different perspectives": {
        "Consider the sport or domain and its rules and conventions": {},
        "Consider the person mentioned and their role or position in the sport or domain": {},
        "Consider the action mentioned and its feasibility in the sport or domain": {}
    },
    "Evaluate the evidence or information available": {
        "Check for any inconsistencies or contradictions in the sentence": {},
        "Check for any ambiguity or unclear language in the sentence": {}
    },
    "Determine the plausibility of the sentence based on the analysis": {
        "If the sentence is consistent with the sport or domain and its rules and conventions, and the action is feasible, then it is plausible": {},
        "If the sentence is inconsistent with the sport or domain and its rules and conventions, or the action is not feasible, then it is not plausible": {}
    }
}
