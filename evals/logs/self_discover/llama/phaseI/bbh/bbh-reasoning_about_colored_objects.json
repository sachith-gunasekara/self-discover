What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed?\n4. How can I simplify the problem so that it is easier to solve?\n9. How can I break down this problem into smaller, more manageable parts?\n16. What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed?\n25. Is the problem a technical or practical one that requires a specific expertise or skill set? Or is it more of a conceptual or theoretical problem?\n38. Let's think step by step.\n39. Let's make a step by step plan and implement it with good notion and explanation.\n\nThese modules can help in identifying the key issue, simplifying the problem, breaking it down into smaller parts, and thinking step by step to arrive at a solution.",
    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. What is the key detail or specific information that I need to focus on in this problem?\n\n4. How can I eliminate irrelevant information and isolate the essential elements of the problem?\n\n9. Can I break down the problem into smaller parts, such as identifying the objects, their colors, and their positions in the arrangement?\n\n16. What is the specific question being asked, and what information do I need to answer it?\n\n25. Is the problem a straightforward identification of a color or object, or does it require a more complex analysis of the arrangement?\n\n38. Let's analyze the problem step by step, starting with the given information and working through the arrangement of objects.\n\n39. Let's create a mental or visual representation of the arrangement and use it to identify the key information and answer the question.",
