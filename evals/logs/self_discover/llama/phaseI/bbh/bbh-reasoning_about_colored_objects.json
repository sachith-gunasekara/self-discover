What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed?\n4. How can I simplify the problem so that it is easier to solve?\n9. How can I break down this problem into smaller, more manageable parts?\n16. What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed?\n17. What are the underlying causes or factors contributing to the problem?\n20. Are there any relevant data or information that can provide insights into the problem? \n25. Is the problem a technical or practical one that requires a specific expertise or skill set? \n38. Let's think step by step.\n39. Let's make a step by step plan and implement it with good notion and explanation.",
    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed in the given arrangement or scenario?\n\n4. How can I simplify the problem by focusing on the specific object, color, or location mentioned in the question?\n\n9. How can I break down this problem into smaller parts, such as identifying the objects, their colors, and their positions in the arrangement?\n\n16. What is the key information or detail that I need to extract from the scenario to answer the question?\n\n17. What are the relevant factors or characteristics of the objects in the scenario that can help me solve the problem, such as their colors, positions, or relationships to each other?\n\n20. Are there any specific details or patterns in the arrangement that can provide insights into the problem, such as the colors or types of objects?\n\n25. Is the problem a spatial or visual one that requires me to visualize and understand the relationships between objects in the scenario?\n\n38. Let's analyze the scenario step by step, focusing on one object or detail at a time to build a clear understanding of the situation.\n\n39. Let's make a step-by-step plan to identify the key information, analyze the relationships between objects, and use that information to answer the question.",
