    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions:\n\n1. What is the core issue or discrepancy in the translation that needs to be identified?\n\n4. How can I break down the translation into smaller components to compare with the original text and simplify the error identification process?\n\n10. Critical Thinking: Analyze the translation from different linguistic and cultural perspectives, questioning assumptions and evaluating the evidence or information available in both the original and translated texts.\n\n13. Use contextual thinking: Consider the translation as part of a larger linguistic and cultural system, understanding the interconnectedness of various elements, such as idioms, colloquialisms, and technical terms.\n\n16. What is the key difference or inconsistency between the original text and the translation that needs to be addressed?\n\n20. Are there any relevant linguistic or cultural references, such as dictionaries, thesauri, or cultural guides, that can provide insights into the translation error?\n\n25. Is the translation error related to a specific domain or field of expertise, such as law, medicine, or technology, that requires specialized knowledge or terminology?\n\n30. Is the translation error a creative or interpretive issue that requires innovative solutions and outside-the-box thinking?\n\n38. Let's analyze the translation step by step, comparing each component with the original text to identify the error.",
