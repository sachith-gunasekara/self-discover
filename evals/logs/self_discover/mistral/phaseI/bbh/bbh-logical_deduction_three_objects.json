It focuses on logical reasoning, evidence-based decision-making, and identifying potential biases or flaws in thinking.\n16 What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed?\n17 What are the underlying causes or factors contributing to the problem?\n29 Is the problem an analytical one that requires data analysis, modeling, or optimization techniques?\n38 Let's think step by step.\n39 Let's make a step by step plan and implement it with good notion and explanation.",
    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions to better solve tasks like those given above:\n\n1 **Design an experiment**: How can I create a hypothetical scenario or arrangement to test the logical consistency of the given statements?\n2 **Systematic solution testing**: List all possible orderings of the objects based on the given statements, and evaluate each one to see which is consistent.\n9 **Problem decomposition**: How can I break down this ordering problem into smaller, more manageable comparisons between two objects at a time?\n10 **Logical analysis**: This style involves analyzing the problem from different perspectives, questioning assumptions, and evaluating the logical consistency of the information available. It focuses on deductive reasoning and identifying potential contradictions or ambiguities in the statements.\n16 **Core issue identification**: What is the primary ordering or ranking that needs to be determined?\n17 **Underlying factors**: What are the given comparisons or relationships between the objects that contribute to the overall ordering?\n29 **Analytical problem check**: Is the problem a logical ordering one that requires comparing and sequencing techniques?\n38 **Step-by-step reasoning**: Let's evaluate each statement step by step to determine the correct order.\n39 **Detailed solution plan**: Let's create a step-by-step plan to compare the objects using the given statements, and explain the reasoning behind each step.",
