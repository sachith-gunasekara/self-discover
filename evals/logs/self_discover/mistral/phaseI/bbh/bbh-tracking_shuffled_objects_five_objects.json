It focuses on logical reasoning, evidence-based decision-making, and identifying potential biases or flaws in thinking.\n28 Let's think step by step.\n38 Let's make a step by step plan and implement it with good notion and explanation.",
    "adapted_modules": "1. **Break down the problem into sequential swaps**: Identify each swap of items (balls, partners, positions, gifts, books) between pairs and track these exchanges step by step.\n\n2. **Critical Thinking for Tracking**: Analyze the sequence of swaps from the perspective of each participant involved. Question and verify the current item held by each person after every exchange. Evaluate the information given at each step to ensure accurate tracking.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Tracking**: Carefully follow each swap in the order it occurs. Update the item held by each participant after each swap.\n\n4. **Implement a Step-by-Step Plan with Clear Explanations**: Create a plan that involves tracking the items from the start, updating the list of who holds what after each swap, and clearly explaining each step of the process. Ensure the final answer is derived logically from the tracked information.",
