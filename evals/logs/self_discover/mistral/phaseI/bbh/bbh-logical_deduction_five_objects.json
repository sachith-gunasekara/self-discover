    "adapted_modules": "1. **Break down the problem into smaller parts**: Identify each object and the relationships or comparisons given (e.g., more expensive, newer, to the left/right of). List these relationships separately.\n\n2. **Critical Thinking**: Analyze the problem from different perspectives by focusing on each object's position or rank based on the given comparisons. Question assumptions about their order and evaluate the information available to form a logical sequence.\n\n3. **Identify the core issue**: Determine what the main question is asking (e.g., which fruit is the second-cheapest, which vehicle is the third-newest, which golfer finished second).\n\n4. **Underlying causes/factors**: Identify the given comparisons or relationships that lead to the arrangement of the objects in a specific order. These are the key factors that will help solve the problem.\n\n5. **Decision-making/Planning**: Based on the comparisons given, decide on the most logical order of the objects. Plan how to use the given information to deduce this order step by step.\n\n6. **Analytical approach**: Use logical deduction and sequential reasoning to analyze the data provided. Model the problem as a sequence or ordering task, and optimize the solution by considering all given comparisons.\n\n7. **Step-by-step thinking**: Start with the most definitive piece of information (e.g., the cheapest, the newest, the leftmost) and gradually build the order of the objects based on the given comparisons.\n\n8. **Step-by-step planning and implementation**: Create a plan that starts with the most clear-cut information, then use each comparison to determine the position of the other objects. Implement this plan methodically, explaining each step based on the given information.",
