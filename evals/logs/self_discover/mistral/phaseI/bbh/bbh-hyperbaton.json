It focuses on logical reasoning, evidence-based decision-making, and identifying potential biases or flaws in thinking.\n20 Are there any relevant data or information that can provide insights into the problem? If yes, what data sources are available, and how can they be analyzed?\n28 Is the problem one that involves decision-making or planning, where choices need to be made under uncertainty or with competing objectives?\n38 Let's think step by step.\n39 Let's make a step by step plan and implement it with good notion and explanation.",
    "adapted_modules": "1 **Design an experiment**: How can I create a test or set of sentences to validate the correct adjective order?\n2 **Generate and evaluate solutions**: List the possible adjective orders based on grammar rules, and apply them to the sentences to see which one is correct.\n3 **Break down the problem**: How can I divide this task into smaller parts, such as identifying the types of adjectives and their correct sequence?\n4 **Critical Thinking**: Analyze the adjective order problem from different linguistic perspectives. Question assumptions about adjective types and evaluate the evidence based on established grammar rules.\n5 **Gather and analyze data**: Are there any linguistic resources or data sets that provide insights into adjective order? If yes, what sources are available, and how can they be analyzed to solve this problem?\n6 **Identify decision-making criteria**: Does the problem require decision-making based on specific grammar rules or exceptions, and how can these be prioritized?\n7 **Step-by-step reasoning**: Let's think through the adjective order rules one at a time and apply them to the given sentences.\n8 **Create and implement a plan**: Let's make a step-by-step plan to identify the types of adjectives, order them based on rules, and verify the correct sentence option.",
