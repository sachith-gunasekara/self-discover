It focuses on logical reasoning, evidence-based decision-making, and identifying potential biases or flaws in thinking.\n16 What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed?\n17 What are the underlying causes or factors contributing to the problem?\n28 Does the problem involve decision-making or planning, where choices need to be made under uncertainty or with competing objectives?\n38 Let's think step by step.\n39 Let's make a step by step plan and implement it with good notion and explanation.",
    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions to better solve tasks like those given above:\n\n1. **Experiment Simulation**: How can I create a step-by-step simulation of the scenario to track changes and solve the problem?\n2. **Systematic Solution Testing**: List all possible outcomes based on the given rules, and evaluate each one to see which one solves the problem.\n3. **Process Deconstruction**: Break down the partner swapping or item exchange process into individual steps to analyze the problem more closely.\n4. **Perspective Analysis**: Analyze the problem from the perspective of each participant (e.g., Alice, Bob, Claire) to understand the flow of partners or items.\n5. **Assumption Validation**: Question and validate assumptions about the initial and final states of the problem to ensure accurate problem-solving.\n6. **Core Question Identification**: What is the main question that needs to be answered to solve the problem?\n7. **Cause and Effect Mapping**: Map out the causes (swaps) and their effects (partner or item changes) to understand the sequence of events.\n8. **Uncertainty Resolution**: Does the problem involve tracking objects or partners through multiple exchanges, requiring resolution of uncertainty at each step?\n9. **Step-by-Step Tracking**: Let's track the partners or items step by step through each swap or exchange.\n10. **Detailed Plan Execution**: Create a detailed, step-by-step plan to track the changes, and execute it with clear explanations for each step.\n\nAdapted module descriptions focus on simulation, systematic evaluation, and tracking changes step by step, which are crucial for solving the given types of tasks.",
