It focuses on logical reasoning, evidence-based decision-making, and identifying potential biases or flaws in thinking.\n16 What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed?\n28 Does the problem involve decision-making or planning, where choices need to be made under uncertainty or with competing objectives?\n38 Let's think step by step.\n39 Let's make a step by step plan and implement it with good notion and explanation.",
    "adapted_modules": "1. **Problem Decomposition**: Break down the sequence of movements into individual steps and direction changes.\n2. **Perspective Analysis**: Consider the impact of each step and turn on the overall direction and distance from the starting point.\n3. **Assumption Questioning**: Challenge assumptions about the direction faced after turns and the net distance traveled.\n4. **Evidence Evaluation**: Assess the cumulative effect of steps and turns based on the given instructions.\n5. **Bias Identification**: Recognize patterns or biases in movements, such as repeatedly turning in one direction.\n6. **Core Issue Identification**: Determine the net displacement and final direction relative to the starting point.\n7. **Decision-Making Under Uncertainty**: Evaluate the uncertainty introduced by turns and resolve the final position accordingly.\n8. **Competing Objectives**: Balance the need to track both distance and direction accurately.\n9. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**: Sequentially process each instruction to update the current position and direction.\n10. **Plan Formulation and Execution**: Create a step-by-step plan to track movements, and execute it with clear explanations for each step.",
