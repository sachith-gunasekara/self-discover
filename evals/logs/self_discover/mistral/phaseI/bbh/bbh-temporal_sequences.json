If yes, what data sources are available, and how can they be analyzed?\n23 How can progress or success in solving the problem be measured or evaluated?\n24 What indicators or metrics can be used?\n39 Let's make a step by step plan and implement it with good notion and explanation.",
    "adapted_modules": "Here are the adapted reasoning module descriptions to better solve tasks like those given above:\n\n1. **Identify the Time Window**: What is the primary time frame in question that needs to be determined?\n2. **Break Down the Day**: How can I segment the day into smaller, manageable time blocks based on the given information?\n3. **Sequential Analysis**: Let's analyze the given time blocks step by step.\n4. **Relevant Observations**: What are the relevant sightings or activities that provide clues about the person's whereabouts at specific times? What are the time ranges given by these observations?\n5. **Elimination Process**: How can I eliminate the time blocks when the person was definitely not at the location in question based on the given observations?\n6. **Possible Time Frames**: What are the remaining time blocks where the person's whereabouts are not accounted for by the observations?\n7. **Validation with Location Hours**: How can I validate the possible time frames with the operating hours of the location in question?\n8. **Determine the Solution**: Which of the remaining time blocks is a valid option for the person to have gone to the location?\n9. **Evaluate the Options**: How can I match the valid time block with the given options to find the correct answer?",
