It focuses on logical reasoning, evidence-based decision-making, and identifying potential biases or flaws in thinking.\n11 Try creative thinking, generate innovative and out-of-the-box ideas to solve the problem. Explore unconventional solutions, thinking beyond traditional boundaries, and encouraging imagination and originality.\n17 What are the underlying causes or factors contributing to the problem?\n20 Are there any relevant data or information that can provide insights into the problem? If yes, what data sources are available, and how can they be analyzed?\n28 Does the problem involve decision-making or planning, where choices need to be made under uncertainty or with competing objectives?\n38 Let's think step by step.\n39 Let's make a step by step plan and implement it with good notion and explanation.",
    "adapted_modules": "1. **Generate and Test Ideas**: Brainstorm various criteria for humor (e.g., puns, wordplay, absurdity) and apply each to the given options to see which one evokes humor when compared to the original name.\n\n2. **Break Down the Problem**: Divide the task into smaller parts, such as identifying the original name, understanding the types of edits made in each option, and evaluating the humorous effect of each edit.\n\n3. **Critical Thinking for Humor**: Analyze each option from different perspectives, such as phonetic similarity, unexpected twists, or pop culture references. Question what makes something humorous and evaluate each option based on those principles.\n\n4. **Creative Thinking for Humor**: Generate innovative and unconventional ideas about what could make an edit humorous. Consider unusual word associations, silly sounds, or clever cultural references.\n\n5. **Identify Underlying Humor Factors**: Determine what underlying factors could make an edit humorous, such as absurdity, wordplay, or innuendo.\n\n6. **Analyze Relevant Data**: Look for patterns or rules in the edits that typically evoke humor, such as changing a letter to create a pun or using a rhyme to create a silly effect. Consider available data sources like humor theories or linguistic studies.\n\n7. **Decision-Making with Humor**: Recognize that the problem involves subjective decision-making about what is humorous. Consider the different aspects of humor that each option might appeal to and weigh them against each other.\n\n8. **Step-by-Step Thinking for Humor**: Approach the task step by step, first understanding the original name, then analyzing each edit, and finally evaluating the humorous effect of each option.\n\n9. **Implement a Step-by-Step Plan**: Create a plan that involves first identifying the type of humor likely to be effective, then analyzing each option for that type of humor, and finally selecting the option that best fits the identified humor type. Clearly explain why each step is taken.",
