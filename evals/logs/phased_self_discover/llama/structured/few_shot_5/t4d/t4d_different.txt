Elizabeth, A and B, however, the options don't allow for multiple answers. Since both Ava and Elizabeth would benefit from receiving helpful information, but Ava's interaction with the object suggests she may be more directly impacted, Ava is the most direct answer among the options.
Mila, B. Benjamin and C. Mila.
Chloe, A. Evelyn.
Logan, C. Sophia.
Jayden, A, B.
Lucas, A. Lucas and B. Jayden, however, the options don't allow for both answers to be selected. Given that both Jayden and Lucas would benefit from receiving helpful information, but the question asks for "Who among the individuals would benefit from receiving helpful information?" without an option for both, it is more logical to select the individual who was not present when the object was moved and therefore may not be aware of its new location.
Evelyn, A. Evelyn and also C. Chloe.
Amelia, A and C.
Ella, A. Ella and B. Lucas, however, the question asks for a single choice, and since the question does not allow for multiple selections, one must consider who is more invested in using the lime. Given the information provided, both Ella and Lucas are equally invested in using the lime. However, a more appropriate answer following the format would be:
Lily, B. Lily and A. Abigail.
William, B. Mia and also A. William.
Oliver, A. Oliver and B. Mila.
Jayden, C. Jayden and also A. Charlotte.
Isla, B. Jayden.
Aiden, B. Lily.

Mila, B. Isabella and C. Mila.
Emma, A. Abigail and C. Emma.
Chloe, A. Nathan.
Chloe, B. Chloe and C. Hannah.
Chloe, B. Evelyn.
Owen, A. Aiden.

Ethan, A and B (However, as per the instruction, I need to select one of the options from the list, and none of the options has both A and B. Considering both A and B are correct, I will choose one among them).

Ava, B. Ella
Mia, B. Ava
Lily, B. Lily and also C. Jacob
Mia, A and B (However, given the choices provided, we can select none of the above as the option that includes both A and B is not available).
Jackson, B. Noah.
Hunter, A. Hunter and B. Noah, however, the given options do not include a "both" option. Given the context of the question, the most accurate answer would be both Hunter and Noah. However, I will choose one of the provided options for the sake of completion.
Amelia, B. Amelia and C. Ella would both benefit, however since the question is phrased to pick one,  C. Ella.
Elizabeth, C. Lily and also B. Elizabeth.
Charlotte, B. Abigail.
James, Both A and B.
Isla, A. Isla and B. Lily.
Chloe, B. Amelia.
Jacob, A. Jacob and B. Jayden.

Jack, B. Jack and C. Mia, however, the question asks for a single individual. Based on the analysis, it can be concluded that both Jack and Mia would benefit from receiving helpful information. However, if a single answer must be chosen from the options provided, the answer would be:
Emily, A. Hannah.
Elizabeth, A and B (both Elizabeth and Jacob). However, since the options do not explicitly allow for multiple answers, I will choose one of the correct answers.
Jackson, B. Mason.
Ava, B. Ava and C. Avery.

Abigail, B, A.
Mia, C. Jacob or A. Mia.
Ethan, B. Olivia and C. Ethan.

Olivia, C. Avery.
Elizabeth, B. Charlotte and C. Elizabeth, however as the question format requires a single choice the most suitable answer would be one of the two main individuals involved with the object in question (the t-shirt).
Elizabeth, B. Elizabeth and A. Emma.
William, A. Oliver.
Abigail, B. Aiden.
Lucas, A. Evelyn.
Elizabeth, C. Noah.
James, A or B.
Jayden, C. Charlotte.
Aiden, B. Aiden and also A. Mila.
Noah, C. Aiden or A. Noah.
Mia, A. Mia and B. Evelyn, but since the question asks for a single choice, we can conclude that both A and B are correct, but the question format does not allow for it. However, based on the provided format, I will choose one of the correct answers.
Ella, B. Carter
Lily, B. Hannah
William, B. William and C. Chloe.
Hannah, C. Aria
Owen, A. Owen and B. Isla, however, the question is a single choice question. Since both Owen and Isla are involved in the planned usage of the tomato, and the question asks for a single choice, it is more likely that the question is asking for one of the individuals involved in the planned usage. In this case, I will choose one of them.
Mia, C. Mia and also B. Jacob.
Ella, B, A. Oliver and Ella.
Abigail, B. Abigail and A. Mia.
Amelia, B and A, however, the options don't allow for multiple answers, but based on the reasoning, we can tell that both Amelia and Alexander would benefit from receiving helpful information, so for the sake of the task, I will choose one.
Evelyn, B. Jackson.
Aiden, A. Aiden and C. Abigail.
