Aiden, A. Liam.
Elizabeth, A.
Isla, A. Hannah
Logan, C. Sophia.
Benjamin, A and C, however, the options don't allow multiple selections so we will choose the option that at least includes one of the two names.
Amelia, C.
Evelyn, B and C, however, the options don't allow for multiple answers. Evelyn also plans to use the corn and based on the sequence of events she would also benefit from receiving helpful information.
Mila, B. Jack.
Jack, A. Aiden
Mila, B. Benjamin and also C. Mila would be correct but since the question asks for a single individual B and C cannot be the answer at the same time.

Hannah, B. Nathan
Benjamin, A. James.
Jacob, A. Abigail
Elizabeth, B. Liam.
Abigail, B. Olivia.
Owen, B. Nathan.
Mia, C and A, however, the given options do not allow multiple answers. Since the question asks "Who among the individuals would benefit from receiving helpful information?" both Isabella and Mia would benefit. However, if we must choose one, we can say Isabella would benefit more as she not only plans to use the jacket but also has an interest in the potato.

Mila, A. Liam.
Avery, A. Ethan
Lily, A. Amelia.
Jackson, B. Mason.
Oliver, B. Jacob.
Abigail, A. Olivia
Nathan, B. Nathan and also A. Amelia, however, the question asks for one person among the options. Since both Amelia and Nathan would benefit from receiving helpful information, and the question format requires selecting one individual, it can be reasoned that both are correct but the format requires one choice.
Chloe, A and B, however, the options do not include both A and B, but it can be inferred that the best answer is not C or D. Considering the options, a more suitable answer would be both A and B, but the options do not include this, therefore the best answer given the options would be A, however this is not fully accurate.
Mila, B. Jack.
Olivia, A. Mason
Sophia, A. Charlotte.
James, A. Evelyn.
Emma, C. Lucas.
Jackson, C.
Mia, B and A are both correct however since that is not an option, the best answer is: B. Ava
Lily, C. Jacob.
Mason, B. Amelia.
Mia, B. Mia and also C. Alexander.
Elizabeth, C. Lily.
Carter, B. Oliver.
Jackson, C. Jackson and B. Mason are both correct answers, however, the prompt requires a single answer, and since Jackson and Mason would both benefit, the most fitting answer from the options is not explicitly available, but based on the instructions to select one, the answer that is most representative is B. Mason.
Avery, C.
Noah, C.
Aiden, C. Mila.
Jackson, B.
Lucas, D.
Abigail, A. Aiden.
Mia, C. Jacob.
James, A. Aiden and B. James, however, the question format requires a single choice, and given that both Aiden and James would benefit, the question seems to be asking for an individual that would benefit the most or is most relevant, in this case, both are equally relevant, but if I must choose one: The final answer is B. James
Ella, A. Mia
William, C. Oliver.
Mia, B.
William, A and B, however, since the option is not available, the closest answer would be to select both individuals separately as the options are given separately.
Oliver, B, C.
Lucas, A. Evelyn.
Aiden, A. Mila.
Noah, C. Aiden
Ethan, A. William
Lily, B. Hannah
Logan, A. Isla
William, C. Chloe.
Hannah, A. James.
Owen, A. Owen and also B. Isla are correct however, the question is phrased to pick one best answer, Isla moved the tomato which may indicate she already has knowledge of it.
Mason, A. Sophia.
Evelyn, A. Aria.
